<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
No types more beautiful could have been
chosen under which to picture the character
of our Lord and the souls He came to
redeem than those of a shepherd and his
flock. As nothing on earth could more fitly
illustrate the infinite love and sacrifice of
the Saviour than the enduring labors and
tenderness of a shepherd, so nothing here
below could better portray the multiple
wants of our spirits than the needful dependent
nature of sheep. After the knowledge
we possess of our Redeemer, only a slight
acquaintance with the characteristics of
pastoral life, as it exists in oriental countries,
is needed to discern the charming fitness
of these comparisons. The similarity
is at once striking and most easily understood.
Hence it is that our Lord, as well
as those who described Him before He
came, so often appealed to shepherd life
when speaking of the Messiah's mission;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page008">[pg 008]</span><a name="Pg008" id="Pg008" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
hence, also, it is that He was so fond of calling
Himself the Good Shepherd, and of
alluding to the souls He loved as His sheep.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is the purpose of the pages that follow
to trace some of these beautiful and touching
resemblances of the shepherd and his
flock, on the one side, roaming over the hills
and plains of Palestine, and the Saviour of
the World with the souls of men, on the
other, pursuing together the journey of life.
We have taken as our guide, in noting these
charming likenesses, the Twenty-second
Psalm, or the Psalm of the Good Shepherd,
every verse of which recalls some feature
or features of pastoral life, and sings of the
offices, tender and varied, which the shepherd
discharges towards his flock.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As this shepherd song was composed and
written in the Hebrew tongue, the language
of ancient Palestine, we have employed here
a literal translation from the original language,
simply because it expresses much
more beautifully and more exactly than
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page009">[pg 009]</span><a name="Pg009" id="Pg009" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
does any rendering from the Latin or Greek
the various marks and characteristics of the
shepherd's life and duties. The oriental
languages, like the people who speak them,
are exceedingly figurative and poetic in
their modes of expression; and hence, for
our present purpose, it is only by getting
back as closely as we can to the original that
we are able adequately to appreciate the
beauty and poetry of that simple but
charming life about which the Psalmist is
singing.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Although the Shepherd Psalm refers, in
its literal sense, to the human shepherd attending
and providing for his sheep, it has
also another higher meaning, which its author
gave it, and this has reference to Christ
in His relations with the souls He has made
and redeemed. It is by reflecting on this
sense of the psalm, and on all His gracious
dealings with us, that we are enabled to
realize how rightly and justly our Saviour
is called the Shepherd of Our Souls, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page010">[pg 010]</span><a name="Pg010" id="Pg010" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
how beautifully the Psalmist, in the shepherd
song, has depicted His relations with
us. And how important this is! how much
it means for our spiritual welfare and spiritual
advancement to reflect on the many
mercies of Christ and on the love He bears
each one of us! If the considerations that
follow assist their readers to appreciate
more fully and love more ardently the Divine
Shepherd of Souls, who daily and constantly
throughout our lives is ministering
to our spiritual needs and trying to further
our eternal interests, the desire and aim
which prompted their writing will be fully
and perfectly realized.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was announced by the prophets of old
that the Messiah, who was to come, should
bear the character of a good shepherd. He
was to be a shepherd, and His followers,
the faithful souls that should believe in
Him and accept His teaching, were to be
His sheep. It was foretold that He would
select and purchase His flock; that He
would choose them from out the vast multitudes
of their kind and gather them into
His fold, that He would provide for them
and guard them against every evil; that He
would lead them out to green pastures and
refresh them with the waters of rest. <span class="tei tei-q">“He
shall feed his flock like a shepherd,”</span> sang
the Prophet Isaias; <span class="tei tei-q">“he shall gather together
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page014">[pg 014]</span><a name="Pg014" id="Pg014" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the lambs with his arms, and shall
take them up in his bosom, and he himself
shall carry them that are with young.”</span><a id="noteref_1" name="noteref_1" href="#note_1"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1</span></span></a>
In like manner did Jeremias, referring to
the comforting advent of Christ, liken the
offices which the Saviour would perform
towards His people to those of shepherds
towards their flocks. <span class="tei tei-q">“I will set up pastors
over them,”</span> said the Prophet, speaking in
the name of Jehovah, <span class="tei tei-q">“and they shall feed
them; they shall fear no more, and they
shall not be dismayed; and none shall be
wanting of their number.... Behold
the days come, saith the Lord, and I will
raise up to David a just branch; and a king
shall reign, and shall be wise, and shall execute
judgment and justice in the earth.”</span><a id="noteref_2" name="noteref_2" href="#note_2"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2</span></span></a>
The Prophet Ezechiel also prophetically
portrayed the Saviour's character when he
pictured Him in the capacity of a shepherd
visiting and feeding his sheep: <span class="tei tei-q">“For thus
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page015">[pg 015]</span><a name="Pg015" id="Pg015" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
saith the Lord God: Behold I myself will
seek my sheep, and I will visit them. As
the shepherd visiteth his flock in the day
when he shall be in the midst of his sheep
that were scattered, so will I visit my sheep,
and I will deliver them out of all the places
where they have been scattered in the cloudy
and dark day. And I will set up one shepherd
over them, and he shall feed them,
even my servant David; he shall feed them,
and he shall be their shepherd.”</span><a id="noteref_3" name="noteref_3" href="#note_3"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And when at length the Saviour did appear
in the world, He declared, not only by
His life and example, but in explicit terms,
that He was the fulfilment of these prophecies—that
He was, in truth, the Good Shepherd,
and that His followers were the sheep
of His fold. In the tenth chapter of the
Gospel according to Saint John we have
His own words to this effect. There He
tells us plainly that He has not come as a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page016">[pg 016]</span><a name="Pg016" id="Pg016" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
thief and a robber, to steal, to kill, and to
destroy; that He is not a stranger, at the
sound of whose voice the sheep are terrified
and flee away; that He is not a hireling,
who cares not for the sheep, and who, beholding
the approach of the wolf and the
enemy, fleeth and leaveth the sheep to be
snatched and scattered and torn. The Saviour
is not any of these, nor like unto them.
He is the Good Shepherd who enters the
sheepfold by the door, and not as the thief
and robber who climb up some other way.
To Him the porter openeth, and He calleth
His sheep, and they know His voice and
follow Him, and He leadeth them out to
pasture, to rest, and to abundant life. Nor
is this all, for He protects and guards His
sheep. By day and by night He is ever
near them: when circling the green plains,
or beside the still waters, or when asleep
beneath the silent stars, the sheep are protected
by their Shepherd. Faithfully He
watches His dependent flock; and at the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page017">[pg 017]</span><a name="Pg017" id="Pg017" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
end, as a proof of His love and fidelity, He
generously lays down His life for His
sheep.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We cannot appreciate the beauty of this
picture of our Saviour under the symbol of
a shepherd, nor can we later understand the
detailed description which is given of Him
through the spiritual meaning of the Good
Shepherd Psalm without first taking into
account some of the features of pastoral life
as it prevails in eastern countries. For us
of the western world it is difficult, and at
times next to impossible, to represent to ourselves
the life and customs of the Orient;
and in particular do we find it hard to picture
to our minds and to understand the
simple poetry of that shepherd life for
which Palestine has always been known.
Time has little changed the scene of the
Saviour's earthly labors. The people, their
manners and customs, their life and occupations,
remain much the same now as when
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page019">[pg 019]</span><a name="Pg019" id="Pg019" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the land was graced by His sacred presence.
Thus today, as in those olden times, all the
level country east of the river Jordan, as
well as the mountains of Palestine and
Syria, serves as vast pasture lands for innumerable
flocks and herds. The country
throughout is essentially pastoral in its character,
and the care and raising of sheep
constitute the chief industry of the people.
From sheep the people are furnished with
nearly all the necessaries of life—with meat,
clothing, milk, butter, and cheese.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The care of sheep is a delicate and, in
many ways, a difficult task. Not that they
are froward or hard to manage, for of all
animals they are the most tender and gentle;
nor again, that they need abundant nourishment
in the way of food and drink, since
they require water but once a day, and can
maintain life and strength on a plain which,
to the naked eye, seems little more than a
barren waste of sand. But because, in other
respects, they are exceedingly timid and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page020">[pg 020]</span><a name="Pg020" id="Pg020" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
helpless creatures, especially in times and
places of danger, the burdens which their
welfare and safety impose upon the shepherd,
while paternal and winning, are,
nevertheless, arduous and manifold. There
are the changes and hardships of the climate—the
cold and frost in winter, and the
heat and drought of summer; there are the
long rough walks, the steep and dangerous
passes which they must climb and descend;
there are perils from robbers, from wolves
and wild beasts, which not infrequently demand
the shepherd's utmost watchfulness
and care. The oriental climate is such that
they can graze nearly the whole year
through; and whether they be grazing on
the wide open plains, or huddled snugly
within the sheepfold, it pertains to the
shepherd to provide for their varied needs.
His vigilance can never cease. He must
lead them out to pasture and to water, he
must guide and protect them, he must
gather them into the fold at night or into
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page021">[pg 021]</span><a name="Pg021" id="Pg021" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
caves and enclosures, at times, during the
day, to shield them from great danger,
whether from enemies or violent weather;
and upon all occasions he must be prepared
to defend them, even at the risk of his own
life.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The folds or sheep pens, it must be observed,
into which the sheep are gathered
for rest or protection are not roofed over or
walled in like a house. They are enclosures
left open to the sky, and consisting simply
of a high wall of rough stone, to protect
the sheep from the attacks of wild beasts,
and from prowling marauders who threaten
their safety by night. It often happens
that several flocks, belonging to different
shepherds, will graze on the same pastures
during the day, and will be penned in the
same sheepfold at night. While the sheep
are sleeping, and the shepherds near by are
taking their needed rest, the door of the fold
is carefully locked, and another shepherd
or porter is left on guard, lest perchance a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page022">[pg 022]</span><a name="Pg022" id="Pg022" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
hungry bear or wolf might scale the wall
and destroy some member or members of
the sleeping herds. Early in the morning
the shepherds come in turn and rap at the
door, and to each the porter opens. Then
each shepherd calls his flock by name; and
they, knowing his voice, follow him, and he
leads them out to their pastures. There is
never any confusion, for each flock knows
its own shepherd and obeys him alone.
Other shepherds they will not heed; and
from the voice of strangers they flee.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is a beautiful scene to see a shepherd
with his flock. First, we must remember
that he never drives them, but leads them;
and they follow him with instinctive love
and trust whithersoever he goes. He usually
carries a rod and a staff: the latter he
uses, when need be, to assist the sheep along
dangerous paths and narrow passages; the
former, to protect and defend them, if assailed
by enemies or beasts of prey. Another
evidence of their implicit love of their
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page023">[pg 023]</span><a name="Pg023" id="Pg023" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
shepherd and trust in his goodness, as also
of their obedience to his voice and commands,
is beautifully manifest when several
flocks are led to drink at the same stream or
well. Although the sheep need to drink
but once a day, the shepherds never forget,
throughout the day's roaming, that they
must lead their flock to water. And as the
drinking places in Palestine are comparatively
few, it often happens that several
herds, whether from the same or neighboring
pastures, will arrive simultaneously at
the same spring. But here again, there is
neither trouble nor confusion. When they
have drawn near to the place of water each
shepherd gives a sign to his flock, and obedient
to his voice, the respective flocks lie
down and patiently wait their turn to drink.
The troughs are then filled with the refreshing
water, and when all is ready a shepherd
calls and his flock at once rises and comes
forward to drink. The sheep being satisfied,
the shepherd gives another sign, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page024">[pg 024]</span><a name="Pg024" id="Pg024" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
they promptly return to their previous place
of rest, or move quietly away to their pasture,
as the shepherd may direct. Another
flock is then called up, watered and led
away, and so on, in like manner, till all have
been duly satisfied.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
With this passing glance at shepherd life,
we can better understand and better appreciate
the likeness between the character of
the Saviour and that of the good shepherd.
We can see how apt it was that our Redeemer
should choose a shepherd, with his
multiple and tender cares and duties, to illustrate
His own watchfulness and loving
kindness towards the many wants and needs
of our souls. For we are, indeed, His sheep.
He has called us, we have heard and understood
His voice, and He has gathered us
into His flock and fold. He has literally
vindicated for Himself in our regard all the
attributes and qualities of the good shepherd,
so far as described, and as still further
depicted in every verse of the Twenty-second
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page025">[pg 025]</span><a name="Pg025" id="Pg025" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Psalm. This is called the Psalm of
the Good Shepherd, because in it the Psalmist,
under the symbol of a shepherd, prophetically
foretold the character of the
Messiah, our Saviour. The psalm has,
therefore, a twofold meaning: in its literal
sense it deals with the faithful shepherd,
ranging with his flock over mountains and
plains, and providing for their every want;
and in its spiritual and prophetic meaning
it relates to our Creator and Saviour, caring
for our spiritual necessities. Let us see how
this is; and that we may better perceive the
application in detail, let us take this shepherd
song, part by part, and see how beautifully
it describes the whole person of
Christ as God, and in His capacity as Redeemer—in
all His tender relations with
us, and towards the various needs of our
souls.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
How full of meaning and how comprehensive
are these simple yet beautiful words
which introduce the Good Shepherd Psalm!
They at once sum up the whole round of the
shepherd's life—his duties, his solicitude,
his ceaseless care of his sheep. But here,
be it noted, in this opening verse, the reference,
so direct and unmistakable, is not to
an earthly shepherd; it is to the benign and
constant Providence of Jehovah towards
His children, to the untiring love of God,
our Father and Saviour, for the souls He
has created and redeemed. The Psalmist
is looking back, in grateful remembrance,
upon the history of his race, and upon his
own life in particular, and he traces there
at every step the goodness and watchfulness
of his Creator. He sees there has never
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page027">[pg 027]</span><a name="Pg027" id="Pg027" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
been any want. Dark days at times have
come upon his nation, sufferings and trials
there have been; and in these, as in other
respects, his own individual experience has
mirrored the history of his people; but
throughout it all there has never been any
lasting want. As the shepherd is ever near
his sheep, whether at peace or in trouble, to
provide for their needs, so, sings the Psalmist
in gratitude, has God been near him and
his people. And his confidence is unshaken;
that which has been in the past will
be in the future; as sheep put their trust in
their shepherd, so will he put his trust in
his Lord and God. Nor is this gratitude
for past favors and this unshaken trust for
the future to be restricted to the Psalmist
alone; his words had meaning not only for
himself; he knows the same Providence
provides for us all, and therefore he would
have his words find an echo in the hearts
and sentiments of all.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Lord is my shepherd; He ruleth me
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page028">[pg 028]</span><a name="Pg028" id="Pg028" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
with the rod of gentleness. I am His creation,
He has bought me with a great price,
He has set me a divine example and taught
me the way to life. There may be times of
distress for me, brief periods of temporal
need; but surely, since I am the possession
of my God, and He is providing for me,
nothing can long be wanting to me—permanent
want there can never be.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Lord ruleth me, and all my kind, as
a shepherd ruleth his flock. What a consoling
thought to each one of us, if only we
be faithful souls! How unspeakable the
thought, how surpassing the privilege to
know and to be assured that we belong to
God! that out of countless millions of creatures,
far nobler than we, to whom He
might have given the joy of life, He has
chosen to select us; to think that He has
allotted to us a short period of existence
here below, during which it is our privilege
to be able to merit and draw near to Him
for eternity; and that after this, our little
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page029">[pg 029]</span><a name="Pg029" id="Pg029" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
time of trial, we are to reign with Him in
everlasting glory! Of a certainty we are a
favored people and a royal race, for we belong
to God. He has purchased our souls
by creating us, He has come down from
Heaven to redeem and buy us back from
the enemy to whom our race in folly had
surrendered itself, He has borne our sorrows
and our sufferings to make amends for
us and to teach us the way to life, and finally
He has given His own life for our salvation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Since, then, God has created us, it follows
that He must have had us in His mind from
everlasting, because nothing that is, or can
be, is unforeseen by Him. From the remotest
dawn of eternity, therefore; from
the very beginning of the eternal years, He
saw us as He sees us now, clearly, distinctly,
lovingly. We did not exist from eternity
as we do now, but we were present to God
before we were to ourselves, He saw us mirrored
in Himself. And when, in time, He
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page030">[pg 030]</span><a name="Pg030" id="Pg030" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
called our race into being and endowed it
with life, we know what happened. This
human nature of ours which He had loved
from eternity, and favored in time with existence,
turned its back upon its God and
strayed away to sin and death. This was
the disobedience of our first parents, and in
their sin we all have shared, for the very
reason that they were our parents and responsible
for us as well as for themselves.
We became a ruined race, deserving punishment,
fit for perdition; and yet God did not
give us up. He followed after us, as it
were; He pursued us, as a shepherd pursues
his chosen flock, until finally He led us back
to His fold, and to pastures of rest and
plenty.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was not enough for God's goodness to
give us the gift of life, and to endow us with
understanding, will, and freedom; it did not
satisfy His bountifulness to make our life
fair here on earth, and to enable us to reap
much of the joys and pleasures with which
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page031">[pg 031]</span><a name="Pg031" id="Pg031" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
even this world abounds—no, far more than
all this has He wished and prepared for His
elect, for the souls who belong to His flock.
It was nothing less than Himself, Heaven
and its rewards, that the eternal Father had
in store for us when He called us into being.
In order, therefore, that we should not lose
our destined crowns through the guilt and
wounds of original sin, He provided for us
a remedy, He sent us a Saviour, who was
His only son, our Lord Jesus Christ.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now since it is to Christ, the Saviour,
that the spiritual meaning of the Shepherd
Psalm refers in a particular manner, it is in
Him especially, and in His earthly life, that
we discern and find fulfilled the chiefest
qualities of the good shepherd. As God,
we see, He has, indeed, been our shepherd
from the beginning, creating and endowing
our nature, and providing for us unnumbered
benefits, temporal and eternal. But
it is in His human nature, in His character
as God and man, that He draws nearest to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page032">[pg 032]</span><a name="Pg032" id="Pg032" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
us and proves unto us in ways most gracious
that He is, in truth, our loving Master and
the Shepherd of our souls. Marvelous, assuredly,
has been the goodness of God to
create us at all; and still more marvelous
that He should have destined us for a participation
in His own eternal blessedness;
but in no way has the heavenly Father so
stooped to us, in no way has He so manifested
His utter condescension towards us,
as in the abasement of His Only-begotten
Son, <span class="tei tei-q">“who, being in the form of God, emptied
himself, taking the form of a servant.”</span><a id="noteref_4" name="noteref_4" href="#note_4"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">4</span></span></a>
For let us reflect that to raise our race from
its fallen state and restore it to the divine
good-pleasure, it was not necessary that the
Second Person of the Most Holy Trinity
should have come down to earth. Such extraordinary
means were not of necessity to
bring us back to Heaven's smile and favor.
As by a simple act of His omnipotent will
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page033">[pg 033]</span><a name="Pg033" id="Pg033" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
God had called the world and us and all
that is out of nothingness in the beginning,
so again by a single wish of the same divine
will He could have restored us, from a condition
of bondage and sin, to the realms of
grace and peace. And even when the Son
of God did condescend, in accordance with
the will of His Father, to clothe Himself
with our nature and visit our blighted
sphere, how simple, really, He could have
made our redemption! How easily could
He have blotted out the handwriting that
was against us, and presented our tearful
world, all smiling and glad, to the arms of
His eternal Father! Yes, Christ could
have made our redemption easy. He could
have paid our debt to God in a thousand
different, simple ways, had He wished it so.
One drop of His precious blood, one tear
of His eye, one sigh of the Sacred Heart
would have sufficed to redeem innumerable
worlds like ours.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But the Saviour wished it otherwise. He
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page034">[pg 034]</span><a name="Pg034" id="Pg034" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
was our Shepherd and He loved us, His
deceived and wounded sheep. He was with
the Father when we were planned and made.
He it was, in truth, who made us, for He
and the Father are one.<a id="noteref_5" name="noteref_5" href="#note_5"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">5</span></span></a> He, therefore,
knew our nature, since He designed and
gave it to us. He foresaw our yearnings
and aspirations; He knew the sublime, transcendent
possibilities of which, with His
help and divine example, we are capable;
He understood the heights of love and worship
to which the human heart can ascend,
when assisted from on high, and hence to
awaken and kindle on earth these all-consuming
fires;<a id="noteref_6" name="noteref_6" href="#note_6"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">6</span></span></a> to stir the very depths of our
souls, and elevate and perfect our gifted
nature; to afford us the utmost inspiration
to climb with Him the heights of Heaven.
He stooped to our own estate, in all things
made like unto us, except, indeed, our proneness
and ability to sin. Since He loved us,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page035">[pg 035]</span><a name="Pg035" id="Pg035" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
He longed to be like us, in as far as that was
possible, and not even our sin-stained,
wounded nature could stay the force of His
love.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is another reason for the mysterious
manner of our redemption, a further
explanation of the extreme condescension
on the part of our Lord towards the frail
creatures whom He came to save. Had he
come to us in a foreign attire, with a nature
unlike our own, would it not have been difficult
for us to approach Him, and to put our
confidence and trust in Him? If He had
appeared like an angel, all bright and dazzling
with glory, if He had come as an
earthly king and ruler, crowned and clad in
regal splendor, would it not have been hard
for the poor ones of earth? would it not
have been a trial for those who were in need
of a shepherd's love and care? Already
sorely oppressed and trodden down by
worldly pomp and power, they could only
have tried to shun His notice and draw
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page036">[pg 036]</span><a name="Pg036" id="Pg036" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
back from Him with feelings of fear and
awe. But our Redeemer came not only to
save, but also to teach and to lead the way
to life. As a shepherd He was not to drive,
but to lead His sheep; He does not point
the direction, but goes before His flock, and
they follow Him, and He leads them out to
living pastures and to bright, sparkling, far-off
waters.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Because He was God, as well as man,
Christ knew that, as a result of our sinful
state, we should have to pass our earthly sojourn
forever beneath the shadow of the
cross. When sin entered into the world by
the disobedience of the first man, the handiwork
of the Creator was despoiled. That
which before had been a paradise of pleasure,
replete with all delights, was wrecked
and ruined, and became a place of sorrow,
suffering and death. Thenceforth, pursuant
to the divine decree, the lot of man was
to labor, to suffer, and to die.<a id="noteref_7" name="noteref_7" href="#note_7"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">7</span></span></a> Knowing,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page037">[pg 037]</span><a name="Pg037" id="Pg037" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
therefore, that this was to be our portion,
the Shepherd-Saviour of our souls must
also teach us the secret of pain and toil, and
help us to bear our cross.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
According, then, to our present state, suffering
and sorrow are inseparable from us,
because we are born into the world with sin
upon our souls, and in the wake of sin follow
all the evils to which the world is heir.
And, moreover, under existing conditions,
it is necessary for our future happiness that
our earthly life be largely spent amidst toil
and pain and tears. It is only through these
that we shall be able to atone for the injuries
sin has done, and hold in check the disorders
of our nature. The cross is before us
and we cannot escape it. It is ready for us
when we enter the world, it follows us
throughout the length of our days, and finally
bears us down in death to our graves.
This does not mean that life on earth is entirely
made up of pain and sorrow, for the
divine mercy has mitigated even the stroke
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page038">[pg 038]</span><a name="Pg038" id="Pg038" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of sin, and has caused the world, in spite of
all its wounds, to bloom with many delights.
Nevertheless, our sojourn here below shall
always be fraught with diverse ills, and we
at last must yield to death. In spite of all
the world can afford us, in spite of its pleasures
and joys, its sunshine and pleasing pastimes,
real, though fitful and fast-flying as
they are; in spite of health and wealth and
fame and honor; in spite of all the goods
that life contains, it still is ever true that
we live in a region of tears, and that death
and sorrow are sure to follow upon the footsteps
of joy and mirth. It must be so, for
the stains of sin are indelibly upon the
world; and not until the final renovation
comes can life on earth be made entirely
happy.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
All this our Saviour knew when He chose
our human nature and embraced a life of
labor and sorrow. His divine foreknowledge
took in our lives, and the lives of all
our kind, until the end of all shall be. Our
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page039">[pg 039]</span><a name="Pg039" id="Pg039" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
infant tears, our trials and pains of body, the
ceaseless pangs of mind and heart that pursue
us throughout life, were all before Him
as in a mirror, and He must needs instruct
and assist us to fight this battle and walk
this way of earth, lest all should perish before
the journey's end. Since we were to
suffer, then He would suffer also; since our
lives were to be amidst labors and trials,
then He would labor and travail also; since
we were to feel the sting of pain, be subject
to heat and cold, be in want, in poverty, and
in distress, be misunderstood, be thwarted,
be cast down from our highest hopes, and
broken, at times, in every cheerful prospect—since
these and other countless ills
were to be woven in our web of earthly life,
He, the divine Master, who came to save, to
teach a lesson, to suffer and die, would assume
a body so sacred, so delicate, so pure
and sensitive that, when exposed to the
rough and ruthless ways of life, He could
truly cry out from the depths of His anguish:
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page040">[pg 040]</span><a name="Pg040" id="Pg040" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“O all ye that pass by the way, attend
and see if there be any sorrow like unto my
sorrow!”</span><a id="noteref_8" name="noteref_8" href="#note_8"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">8</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
How comforting, then, it is for us to feel
that we are not alone in suffering, and to
know that, while all we suffer is but just and
due to our sinful state, we can nevertheless
make use of all our ills to attain to joys unending
in Heaven! If we must toil and
struggle while on earth, it is because these
things are a result of our state; if we must
be subject to sickness, to weakness and fatigue,
to cold and hunger, to weariness and
pain, it is not because God is pleased at the
misery of His creatures; neither does He
rejoice on account of our misfortune. We
are simply reaping the harvest of sin and
transgression, and sin is the work of our own
free choice and that of our ancestors. And
even though it be objected that we are born
into this inevitable condition, and are made
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page041">[pg 041]</span><a name="Pg041" id="Pg041" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the unconsulted heirs of a heritage we loathe
but cannot escape, the solution of our difficulty
is not far to seek. We need but hearken
to the promptings of reason, and lift our
sorrowing eyes to the realms of faith to be
convinced that God's mercy and goodness
are above all His works,<a id="noteref_9" name="noteref_9" href="#note_9"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">9</span></span></a> and that for reasons
not less benevolent than holy He has
called us into life and permitted all our
woes. God could not have created us for
suffering and punishment, because He is infinite
goodness; He cannot be pleased at
our misfortunes, since He Himself has
borne our sorrows and carried all our
pains.<a id="noteref_10" name="noteref_10" href="#note_10"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">10</span></span></a> If He Himself had not come into
the world in visible human form; if He had
not explained our purpose and destiny, and
led the way to Heaven; if He had not, by
His words and divine example, provided us
with the solution for all life's difficulties,
then, in truth, we might object, and sit and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page042">[pg 042]</span><a name="Pg042" id="Pg042" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
grieve and wonder. But in the light of the
life of Christ all this is altered; the picture
takes on a different coloring. Who now
can rail at the crosses of life and think of
the sufferings of Christ? Who can murmur
at the injustice of pain, and remember
the passion of Jesus? Who can say that
God is deaf to our pleading and unmoved
at our tears, and look upon the Saviour dying?
Who can believe that our lives are
of little worth, or of no account with the
Almighty, and recall the price that was paid
for our souls and ponder the death of our
God?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus it is with a bountiful goodness that
the Saviour has purchased His sheep. By
His own free choice, by a life of suffering
entirely voluntary, endured for our salvation
and instruction, through a bitter, but
willing agony and death, He has provided
the means to free us from sin, and has bequeathed
to us every blessing. Now we
can truly say: the Lord is my shepherd, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page043">[pg 043]</span><a name="Pg043" id="Pg043" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
I shall not want. If only we can look into
that divine life which has been given as our
model, if only we can ponder it, and read
in it the lessons, the hopes, the inspirations
it contains for us, we shall not be weary of
our burdens and cares, we shall not falter
in any of life's battles. Rather, rejoicing
at our opportunities, eternal as they are, and
with feelings of exultant gratitude over our
condition, as heirs with Christ to the kingdom
of Heaven,<a id="noteref_11" name="noteref_11" href="#note_11"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">11</span></span></a> we shall bravely welcome
all the conflicts of life, being assured with
St. Paul that <span class="tei tei-q">“that which is at present momentary
and light of our tribulation, worketh
for us above measure exceedingly an
eternal weight of glory.”</span><a id="noteref_12" name="noteref_12" href="#note_12"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">12</span></span></a>

Our attention is now directed to a particular
phase of the shepherd's life, and here
we see some of the ways in which he actually
provides for his sheep day by day. For it is
not enough that the shepherd has purchased
his flock, by means however difficult and
labors however loving; it is not sufficient
that he have procured for them, in a general
manner, all that they need for their life and
safety, he must also arrange for their daily
care and provide for their separate wants.
Sheep, as we know, are delicate creatures,
and they must be directed in their roamings,
and sustained by sufficient nourishment.
Accordingly, we have said that it
belongs to the duties of a good shepherd to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page045">[pg 045]</span><a name="Pg045" id="Pg045" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
lead them out to pasture, and to provide for
them every day adequate food and drink.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Here again we behold the infinite kindness
of the Shepherd of our souls. Not
alone has He deigned to stoop to our fallen
state and restore us from death to life, not
only did He take upon Himself our infirmities
and bear our woes, but tenderly also has
He provided for our constant direction, and
for the daily needs of our lives.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The level to which the Saviour raised our
lives and the dignity to which He invites us
are far, indeed, above our natural powers.
Left to ourselves, we could never attain the
heavenly heights to which, in His goodness,
He has called us. Through the infinite
merits of His life and sacrifice we have been
redeemed and reclaimed from the enemy of
our souls; the gates of Heaven, closed
against us before, have been opened wide;
and our wayward race is again restored to
the road that leads to our immortal home.
But just because our celestial destiny is of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page046">[pg 046]</span><a name="Pg046" id="Pg046" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
so high and sublime a character, it is impossible,
if left to our own abilities, that we
should be able long to pursue it, and vastly
beyond our sublimest hopes that we should
ever finally attain it. We have, it is true,
ever before us, the life and example of Him
who has saved us; we know that His cross
and death have delivered us from the wrath
that frowned upon us. But we are weak
and fragile mortals. With respect to things
of the higher life—of the supernatural
world—we, of ourselves, shall always remain
as helpless and frail as infants. Not
less unable is the babe of yesterday to traverse
unaided and explore the material
world, than the wisest of men would be to
know and grasp by his natural powers the
unrevealed good of the immortal human
spirit. And as, in our natural state, we
could not know the true end of our existence,
without a divine revelation, so likewise,
we could not pursue and attain our
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page047">[pg 047]</span><a name="Pg047" id="Pg047" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
spiritual destiny without special assistance
from on high.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
How well all this was known to our kind
and kingly Shepherd! How keenly did He
appreciate our frailty and inability to walk
alone the paths which He had trodden! Not
unmindful, therefore, was He constantly to
teach and direct the way which leads to unending
life. When going before his flock
and teaching them by force of example, He
did not omit to give them that saving doctrine
which, when He had disappeared,
would be their guide, and the guide to their
future shepherds in the direction of safety
and truth. Hence He propounded a teaching
which should be to its obedient followers
a realization at once of all He had promised
them, and of all their heart's desires.
Not that it would make them rich or great
in the eyes of the world and according to
human standards, but that it would confer
a truer and a higher greatness by lifting
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page048">[pg 048]</span><a name="Pg048" id="Pg048" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
them above their weak and natural level
and preparing them for eternal blessedness.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Men had the Law before the coming of
Christ; they knew the ten commandments.
But the state to which the God-man called
them, and the eminence to which they were
raised, were quite beyond anything the
world till then had ever been able to conceive.
Human nature, under the New Covenant,
was invited to attain to perfection.
Things which before were thought impossible,
were now to be the objects of our daily
strivings. It was no longer an eye for an
eye, and a tooth for a tooth; now not only
was good to be done to those who were good
to us, but to those also who did us evil; not
only were we to love our friends, but to love
and assist our enemies also; not only should
evil deeds be avoided, but evil thoughts
were likewise forbidden—yea, we were
asked to be, in all our thoughts and deeds,
imitators of the Shepherd who leads us.<a id="noteref_13" name="noteref_13" href="#note_13"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">13</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Poor human nature, when raised so high
above its natural powers, stood in perilous
need of a shepherd's tender care. The new
demands of every day made indispensible
new and special daily helps. While our
spirits can see and know the way, under the
light of heavenly teaching, yet how weak
and faltering is our flesh! We have the
will to do; but to accomplish, we alone are
not able. Therefore our Saviour said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Of
yourselves, you can do nothing, but in me
all things are possible to you. The branches
are nothing unless they abide in the vine; I
am the vine, you the branches.”</span><a id="noteref_14" name="noteref_14" href="#note_14"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">14</span></span></a> Thus He
is our Leader, our divine Teacher and our
source of strength. Without Him we can
do nothing, but in Him we are strong. And
daily and constantly He is near us, though
we see Him not. It is He who sustains our
very life and moves us to all that is good.
Like an ever-present friend, He offers us
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page050">[pg 050]</span><a name="Pg050" id="Pg050" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
constant assistance: He instructs and guides
and helps us, and this is the strength and
food of our souls. God's grace it is, always
ready for our use, which makes possible all
the high demands put upon our nature.
Without it we should faint and starve on
our journey, and hence He who has planned
our high perfection, has provided the help
to attain it. What are those seven wonderful
sacraments which He has left us, but
perennial channels of grace, constant fountains
from which stream the life-giving
waters that nourish our weary souls and
make them strong for life eternal! Through
these sacred means we are brought into contact
with the life and merits of our Shepherd-Redeemer.
They prolong His life
and labors among us, they continue in our
midst the strength of His sacred presence.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In a manner altogether special is this true
of the Holy Sacrament of the altar. By the
Holy Eucharist, Christ still is with us, and
will so remain till the end of time, as really
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page051">[pg 051]</span><a name="Pg051" id="Pg051" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and as truly as He dwelt on earth in the days
of His mortal life. Bound down as we are
by the things of sense, we may, at times, be
tempted to complain that Christ in this sacrament
is all invisible to us. We can not
see Him directly and immediately. His
voice is silent and we do not hear Him; we
do not feel the caress of His hand. But
nevertheless we know He is present, for He
has said it, and His word must remain,
though heaven and earth should pass away.
Even were we privileged to see the sacred
humanity as it was seen of old in Palestine,
we should not then, more than now in this
sacrament, directly see the divinity concealed
by the human frame. Faith then
was required as well as now—faith in His
sacred words, made evident by His sacred
deeds. This is not strange; it is not too
much to ask. The same demand of faith is
daily made upon us in much of our intercourse
with our fellow mortals. Much that
we do not clearly see we must perforce believe,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page052">[pg 052]</span><a name="Pg052" id="Pg052" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
else life would be impossible. The
same, in a measure, is also true in all our
human friendships. That which is most
precious in our friends, that which is the
source of life and beauty, of holy words and
loving actions, of all we love and cherish
in them, is the soul, the spirit that quickens
and moves; and this we do not see.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus Christ in the Eucharist is truly present,
though faith alone can apprehend Him.
He requires of us this faith—this humble
subjection of our sensible faculties to the
power and truth of His words. It is all for
our good that now He is hidden from our
sight. He is not the less truly present, not
less truly kind, not less loving, not less merciful
and forbearing; but He wishes to exercise
our faith, to prove our fidelity and
trust in His teaching and promises, and
hence He is hidden from the powers of our
senses.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the sacrament of the Eucharist the
gracious Shepherd of our souls performs in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page053">[pg 053]</span><a name="Pg053" id="Pg053" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
particular three offices for us: He is our
sacrifice, our silent patient friend, and in
communion He becomes the actual spiritual
food of our souls. As a victim He is daily
and constantly, from the rising to the setting
of the sun, lifted up for us in the holy
sacrifice of the mass. The mass is the perpetuation
of the sacrifice He offered long
ago for our redemption. All the altars
throughout the world, on which He is ever
born and dies again in mystic repetition, are
but an extension of the one great altar of
Calvary, where first He gave His life for
our salvation. And in this real and awful
sacrifice, forever repeated in our midst, He
pleads again our cause with God, the eternal
Father. Again in a mystic manner He
suffers for us, again He bleeds, again He is
nailed to the cross and raised on high, and
in that same abandoned, pitiable state, to
which His love for His flock has reduced
Him, ever and anon in our behalf He
pleads: <span class="tei tei-q">“Father forgive them, for they
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page054">[pg 054]</span><a name="Pg054" id="Pg054" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
know not what they do!<a id="noteref_15" name="noteref_15" href="#note_15"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">15</span></span></a> Holy Father,
Powerful God, stay Thy avenging hand!
and save the souls which Thou hast created
for Thyself, and for which till the end of
time I die!”</span> He lifts, as it were, before
the great white throne, His bruised and
blood-stained hands, He shows those
wounded feet, the scar of the spear in His
sacred side; He points again to the agony
in the garden, to the scourging at the pillar,
to the cruel crown of thorns, to the weary
way of the cross, and exclaims to Him who
sits upon the throne, <span class="tei tei-q">“Behold, my Father,
and see the price of my sheep, the tears and
sorrow and blood they have cost me! and
spare them and save them for the sake of
Thy Son!”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Through the holy sacrifice of the mass,
identical as it is with the sacrifice of Calvary,
all the merits of Christ's life and death
are applied to our souls. By His physical
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page055">[pg 055]</span><a name="Pg055" id="Pg055" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and bloody immolation on Calvary, Christ
purchased for us infinite treasures of grace,
and it is His will that these graces shall be
dispensed to us, even till the end of the
world, through the august sacrament of the
altar. Moreover, except for the mass, we
should not be blessed with the abiding actual
presence of our divine Shepherd among
us—that is, we should not possess Him in
that special, intimate manner in which we
now have Him in the Eucharist. For it is
only in the mass that the sacred species are
consecrated; and consequently it is through
the mass alone that He takes up His sacramental
presence in our midst and becomes
our food in holy communion. He could,
indeed, have ordained it otherwise, but such
has been His blessed will, and such the condition
in which we are placed by the direction
of His holy Church.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Besides being our daily sacrifice, then,
under the appearance of bread and wine,
besides ever prolonging in our midst that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page056">[pg 056]</span><a name="Pg056" id="Pg056" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
wondrous act of Calvary by which at once
He liberated our race and reopened to us
the gates of Heaven, the bounteous Shepherd
of our souls enters into the tabernacles
of our churches, and there in silent patient
waiting He craves the love of our hearts
and longs for our intimate friendship. He
is not content alone to plead for us with
God, His Father; He is not content continually
to renew in our presence the tragic
mystery by which at the end of His earthly
labors, He procured us every blessing—no,
over and above these sovereign acts of kindest
benediction, He wishes to remain among
us, and to converse with us, each and all, as
a friend would converse with his friend.
This is what He meant when He said by the
mouth of His inspired writer, <span class="tei tei-q">“my delights
are to be with the children of men.”</span><a id="noteref_16" name="noteref_16" href="#note_16"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">16</span></span></a> As
a Shepherd, His chiefest pleasure, as well
as His supremest care, is to be with the flock
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page057">[pg 057]</span><a name="Pg057" id="Pg057" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
He has purchased and loves. Yet it is a
lonely life for our Shepherd-King, this
abode in the silent tabernacle; but it is
all for love of us. He wishes to be there
where we can find Him, where we can come
to Him at any hour and speak to Him, to
praise and thank Him for all His dear and
endless gifts, to tell Him our needs and our
sorrows, to open our breaking hearts to Him
and reveal the secrets of our souls. This it
is that He desires from us—the outpouring
of our hearts and souls in His presence.
This it is which renders unto Him that
homage of faith and love and devotion that
He came into the world to inspire. It will
not do to say that, being God, He is acquainted
with all our thoughts and aware of
all our wants, for it is intimacy and confidence
that He desires, the intimacy and confidence
which alone can create a true and
noble friendship. <span class="tei tei-q">“I will call you no longer
servants,”</span> He said to His disciples, <span class="tei tei-q">“but I
have called you friends; the servant knoweth
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page058">[pg 058]</span><a name="Pg058" id="Pg058" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
not what his Master doth, but a friend
is admitted to confidence.”</span><a id="noteref_17" name="noteref_17" href="#note_17"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">17</span></span></a> Christ in the
tabernacle is our friend; He has loved us
unto the end, and He yearns for our love in
return. Why is this? Why are we so precious
in His eyes? What are we that the
great Creator should at all be mindful of
us?<a id="noteref_18" name="noteref_18" href="#note_18"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">18</span></span></a> We must remember and ever bear
in mind the lofty purpose which the Creator
had in view when first He called us into being—the
same purpose it was which prompted
our redemption and all the gracious dispensations
that have followed thereupon—namely,
that God, while achieving His own
eternal honor and glory, might communicate
to us a portion of His own ineffable
blessedness. We were made for God, and
not for the world, or for creatures, or for
ourselves. And precisely because we are
the possession and property of God, He
wants us, soul and body, for Himself; and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page059">[pg 059]</span><a name="Pg059" id="Pg059" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in this blessed sacrament He calls to us individually,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Son, give Me thy heart;”</span><a id="noteref_19" name="noteref_19" href="#note_19"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">19</span></span></a>

and find rest for your souls, I will lead
you beside the waters of quietness.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But the excesses of our Shepherd's love
and care do not stop with the altar and with
the tabernacle. He is not satisfied with being
our daily sacrifice and our abiding
friend, not satisfied until He enters into our
very bosom and unites us to Himself.
Union with the beloved object and delight
in its presence are characteristic of all true
friendship, whether human or divine. That
which we really love we desire to have, to
possess, to be united with; and hence it is
that Christ, the lover of our souls, has not
only given His life to purchase us for Himself
and Heaven, but has so extended His
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page060">[pg 060]</span><a name="Pg060" id="Pg060" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
loving-kindness as to become Himself our
actual food.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is incomprehensible, in a human way,
that the love of a shepherd for his flock, the
love of God for His creatures, should be so
extraordinary as to provide the wondrous
benefits which Christ in the Eucharist has
wrought for us. We simply cannot grasp
with our feeble minds the prodigality of
such enduring love. But the Saviour knew
His purpose with us, and He knew the
needs of our souls. As guests destined for
an eternal banquet, and as heirs to celestial
thrones, it is needful for us, amid the rough
ways and perils of life, to be constantly reminded
of our royal destiny and strengthened
against our daily foes. This world of
ours is an arena in which each one must contend
for his eternal prize; and it is not possible,
considering our natural frailty and the
enemies that oppose our forward march,
that we alone, without an added strength,
should ever be able to win the battle of life.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page061">[pg 061]</span><a name="Pg061" id="Pg061" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

Hence, as the body, to maintain its vigor
and perform its work, needs its material
and earthly food, so the soul, to live and be
strong, must be nourished with the bread of
Heaven. <span class="tei tei-q">“The bread that I will give,”</span> said
our Lord, <span class="tei tei-q">“is my flesh for the life of the
world ... unless you eat of this
bread you cannot have life in you ...
and he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my
blood hath life everlasting, and I will raise
him up on the last day.”</span><a id="noteref_21" name="noteref_21" href="#note_21"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">21</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In order, then, to sustain our spiritual life
on earth and to make us strong for our daily
conflicts, our heavenly Shepherd has left us
a food which is none other than His own
body and blood. What a prodigy of love!
What could He do for us that He has not
done? But, besides giving us strength, He
had another purpose in becoming our food.
Since He has chosen us for Himself, and
has provided, in another world, eternal
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page062">[pg 062]</span><a name="Pg062" id="Pg062" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
mansions for our souls,<a id="noteref_22" name="noteref_22" href="#note_22"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">22</span></span></a> He wishes to make
certain, not only the happy issue of our
lives, but our ever-increasing resemblance
to Himself. He is therefore preparing us,
He is fitting us, through communion in the
Holy Eucharist, for our celestial home, and
for visible companionship with Himself.
Intercourse, communion, intimate relationship
produce likeness, even here on earth,
and it is a singular effect of Holy Communion
that, unlike earthly food, it changes
into itself all those who partake of it. Material,
natural food becomes the substance
of our flesh and blood, but frequent participation
in the heavenly nourishment of
Christ in the Eucharist transmutes our
whole being—our lives and thoughts and
actions—into its own supernatural character.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus by living much with Christ on
earth, by intimate converse with Him, by
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page063">[pg 063]</span><a name="Pg063" id="Pg063" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
allowing Him to enter into our lives and
thoughts, and shape our conduct and actions;
and above all, by frequent and fervent
communion with Him in the sacrament
of His love, we become like unto Him, even
here in our state of exile. And this likeness
to Christ, which His faithful servants
assume here below, is a forestate of future
blessedness; it is a preparation for the great
reunion and the eternal banquet which
await us in Heaven. Already we are led
beside the waters of rest; we are directed
to pastures of sweetest nourishment; and
through the calm and vigor that reign in
the soul we experience even now a taste of

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Throughout the pastoral country of the
Orient there are numerous places of great
peril for sheep. There are also, here and
there, private fields and vineyards and gardens
into which, if a member of a flock
should stray and be caught, it is forfeited
to the owner of the land. Strange as it may
seem, the sheep never learn to avoid these
dangerous spots and forbidden places, and
it behooves the shepherd to be ever on his
guard for them, and to rescue them when
wandering.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Here we cannot fail to observe the striking
resemblance between this wayward tendency
of the shepherd's flock and our own
inclination and propensity to wander from
God and things eternal. The world is full
of occasions to evil; at every turn of the
road on our journey through life there are
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page065">[pg 065]</span><a name="Pg065" id="Pg065" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
fierce and crouching enemies who are waiting
the chance to capture and bear us away.
We know this; we have often been warned
of the danger; too many sad experiences
and breathless escapes have convinced us of
the sundry perils to soul and body that lie
along the way of life. But we, like senseless,
erring sheep, if bereft of the Shepherd's
guiding care, do not learn, in life's
sad school, the way to keep free from harm.
Though wounded repeatedly, and scarred
and worn, and left, perhaps, without human
aid, to waste and bleed our life away,
we do not see the lurking evils; we do not
discern beneath the mask the enemy whose
purpose is ruin and death.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The creatures of the world, the things of
sense take vicious hold of us, and often drag
us to the very verge of perdition before we
are aware. They come to us unprepared,
and seek entrance into our lives and
thoughts, and allure us by deception. They
tell us that the world is fair and beautiful
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page066">[pg 066]</span><a name="Pg066" id="Pg066" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and full of promise; that God, for the moment,
is not concerned; that the soul is secure
and safe, and the body and its needs
the only object of present solicitude. The
process is gradual. The turning away and
the loss are not at once and from the beginning
of seductive influences, but slowly and
unobtrusively in the guise of hope and high
expectation. There is Ambition, with its
glittering prospects, with its proffered rewards
and castles of air. To the young man
and young woman, just entering the arena
of life, Ambition says, <span class="tei tei-q">“Come and follow
me, and I will crown you with glory and
honor. I will lift you above the common,
beaten paths of men and seat you on a gilded
throne. I will introduce you to my sister
Pride, and we two will make you happy.
Pride will teach you your true dignity, your
place and position in the universe; she will
remind you of your gifts and faculties, and
enable you to battle with the weak and the
strong; she will give you the secret of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page067">[pg 067]</span><a name="Pg067" id="Pg067" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
knowledge and train you to soar above your
fellow-creatures and probe the mysteries of
God and Heaven.”</span> Then Pleasure, with
dimpled cheeks and laughing eyes, and
words that sound like music to the ears,
hurries out to greet the passers-by, and
charms them by her shining gifts. <span class="tei tei-q">“Make
me your object and your end,”</span> she says,
<span class="tei tei-q">“and I will make you blessed. Forget your
troubles and your cares, your fears of present
and future ills; rejoice and be glad, eat,
drink and be merry; indulge and drain to
dregs the cups of sense, for this is all there
is.”</span> Philosophy comes with another hope.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Drink deeply,”</span> she counsels, <span class="tei tei-q">“at the spring
of wisdom, and fear not God nor man; believe
and trust in me, and I will steal away
the sting of sorrow and pain; I will restore
you to man's primeval state and land you
safe on the shores of rest.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And when these deceivers—Ambition,
Pride, Pleasure, and the like—have plundered
and sacked their victim's goods, when
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page068">[pg 068]</span><a name="Pg068" id="Pg068" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
these painted idols of a passing world have
led away their worshippers as slaves, and
stripped them of all they possessed, they
give them over to evil habits and to masters
that scourge and tear them. Like other
prodigals, these pursuers of earthly phantoms
take leave of their Father's house of
comfort and plenty, they give up virtue, innocence,
honesty, purity; they go into a far
country to waste their substance living riotously,
only to awake, soon at latest, to a land
of famine, and to find themselves alone and
in want. Instead of the honor and fame
and high estate they sought to gain, instead
of the escape from evil and pain and labor
they hoped to find, they are sent into fields
to minister to swine—the swine of their own
degradation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
So, to a degree, it is with us, each and all,
who listen to other voices and heed other
calls than the voice and the call of God. If
we prefer to stray to other fields and desert
the pasture of our Shepherd, if we prefer a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page069">[pg 069]</span><a name="Pg069" id="Pg069" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
far country to our Father's home, if the
world and its fleeting pleasures are more to
us than God and His paternal rewards,
then we must of necessity find ourselves at
length in utter want and penury. It is this
possibility of deserting God, of seeking happiness
outside of Him, of overturning the
plans which He has made for our salvation,
that gives us a vision of the awful failure of
human life. The gifts of this world are by
nature fleeting and fast-flying, and if we
allow them to take the place of Him who
made them, no matter how great our present
boons, in spite of wealth and friends
and all success, we have missed our chance
and our purpose in the world, and can only
have at last a desolate and a ruined life.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But how is it, then, one may ask, that
man can be so deceived? How is it that
we do not learn from others' disasters to
avoid, every one of us, those deceiving, ruinous
masters, those false gods that can lead
us away from the one true Shepherd of our
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page070">[pg 070]</span><a name="Pg070" id="Pg070" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
souls? It is, indeed, a curious fact that our
deception is so easy. Surely a rational, intelligent
being, who stops to consider, ought
easily to distinguish between the great God
of Heaven and the creatures of His hands.
It ought not to be difficult for us to see the
transient vanity of human things when compared
with the eternal mansions. But the
truth of the matter is, that we <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">are</span></em> deceived,
we do not at all times see the objects of our
choice as they really are objectively. Our
vision is defective and blurred. If God
stood out in our lives as He really ought to
stand, if He occupied that place in our
thoughts and plans which belongs to Him
by right, it would not be possible that
we should ever be led astray. And that
God does not always hold in our lives
the place which is His due is partly the
result of our fallen nature; partly, therefore,
in a way, excusable; but more frequently
and chiefly from our own perversity—from
wilful neglect of our highest duties.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page071">[pg 071]</span><a name="Pg071" id="Pg071" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The blindness and perversity of our nature,
which have come from the wounds of
original sin, make it easy for us, if we are
neglectful and careless of our higher spiritual
obligations, to mistake the false for the
true, evil for good, the creature for the Creator.
In the midst of the world and its allurements,
it behooves us to be ever watching,
if we are never to stumble and to fall.
Had our nature never been corrupted by
original unfaithfulness, had our first parents
never turned away from God and transgressed
His sacred precept, all our present
ills would never have existed. But now it
is different. We are born into the world a
weakened people; each one of us has had
an implicit part in the first transgression;
we all, like erring sheep, have gone astray.
And while this tendency to evil is part of
our natural condition, and therefore less imputable
to us, it nevertheless is true that
our actual sins and evil-doing are the work
of our deliberate choice. If, at any time,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page072">[pg 072]</span><a name="Pg072" id="Pg072" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
we really turn away from God and break
His law, it is because we have freely chosen
so to act. The native perversity of nature
in a normal man can never explain and excuse
the grievous sins which he deliberately
commits. It is only true that a weak and
wounded nature leaves one less able to
choose what is right, and more disposed to
wrong. And since we know the state of
things, since we know that the fault is really
ours when we dare to stray to forbidden
deeds and places, how constant and unrelenting,
if we are truly wise, should be our
efforts to keep our vision unobscured and
our ears attuned to the voice and call of our
heavenly Shepherd! We know that by following
Him our way will be certain and
clear. Howsoever enormous the evils of
life, and notwithstanding all our weakness,
we know that in Him we are safe and strong.
But we must hear Him to follow Him, we
must be guided and directed by His gracious
commands.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page073">[pg 073]</span><a name="Pg073" id="Pg073" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This failure to hear and obey the voice of
God it is which more explains the falls and
sins of men than all their inherited frailty.
So long as His words are heard and directions
heeded, mistake and error are impossible.
We see, therefore, why it is that so
many actually do desert Him and are led
by evil voices. The cause chiefly lies in the
wilfulness of human nature and in the abuse
of human liberty. We cannot stand unless
God support us, and we shall surely fall if
He withdraws His supporting hand. But
the choice of evil, the beginning of unfaithfulness
comes from ourselves; for Almighty
God will never forsake us unless we first
forsake Him.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If, ever, then, we find our lives to be at
variance with God, whether in lesser or in
greater matters, if it should ever be our
unhappy fortune to wander from Him, like
another prodigal, and waste our lives with
the enemies of our souls, we can be assured
that the desertion is all our own. We forget
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page074">[pg 074]</span><a name="Pg074" id="Pg074" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
God, we deliberately wander from His
sight and care, and then we fall. Engrossed
in worldly affairs, taken up with present
vanities, with ourselves, our ease, our temporal
advancement, we begin to neglect
prayer and communion with God, we begin
to rely on ourselves and to forge ahead of
our own accord, only to encounter complete
defeat and be shorn of all our strength. The
secret of our power and success is to keep
close to Him, to speak to Him lovingly and
often, to seek guidance and protection from
Him, and habitually to live in His comforting
presence.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But such is the boundless kindness of our
heavenly Shepherd that, no matter how
often we may have wandered from Him, or
how seriously we may have grieved Him,
He is ever ready to pursue our wanderings,
and to seek until He finds us. He does not
stop to consider the enormity of our guilt,
or our unreasonableness, or our ingratitude,
but He seeks us. He does not pause to take
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page075">[pg 075]</span><a name="Pg075" id="Pg075" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
an account of all He has done for us, of the
many graces He has given us, of the tears
and blood He has shed in our behalf; but
He goes after our straying souls, and He
will not be appeased until He restore us.
God does not will the death of the sinner,
but that he be converted and live.<a id="noteref_23" name="noteref_23" href="#note_23"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">23</span></span></a> He
knows all our frailties and our diverse
temptations; He knows how alluring are
the things of sense to a nature perverted like
ours; He knows how easy it is for us, blind
and ignorant as we are, to forget Him and
our dearest interests, and to obey the call of
other voices; all this He understands, and
He has pity on us. <span class="tei tei-q">“He knoweth our frame,
He remembereth that we are dust.”</span><a id="noteref_24" name="noteref_24" href="#note_24"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">24</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To bring us back, therefore, when wandering,
and to restore us to the circle of His
chosen flock, our Saviour has made ample
provision. Through those divine mediums
of grace—the sacraments of His Church—He
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page076">[pg 076]</span><a name="Pg076" id="Pg076" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
has arranged to succor all our wants
and to cure our various infirmities. The
sacraments of Baptism and Penance, in
particular, were instituted to raise our souls
from death to life, and to heal our spiritual
wounds. Baptism may be aptly compared
to the door of the sheepfold. It is the gate
through which men must enter into the fold
of Christ, it is the entrance to His Church.
It clears away the guilt and stain of original
sin, and restores the soul from a state of enmity
to the friendship and grace of God.
None can really belong to Christ, none can
be of His true fold who have not entered
by way of the door, who have not been baptized.
Many there are who pretend to belong
to Him and think themselves of the
number of His flock; they speak of Him as
their Master and Shepherd; they pretend
to be doing His work; they call Him Lord
and preach in His name; but they have not
entered by the door of the sheepfold, and He
knows them not. Like thieves and robbers,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page077">[pg 077]</span><a name="Pg077" id="Pg077" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
they have climbed up some other way, and
they neither know Him, nor does He know
them, neither can they understand His
voice. Baptism is the entrance, it is the
door, to the fold of Christ.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And as it is through Baptism that our
bountiful Lord first recalls us from the ways
of sin and makes us members of his flock,
so in the sacrament of Penance He has provided
a means by which we may at all times
be recalled from our wanderings and restored
to His friendship. Penance is an
inexhaustible means of reconciliation between
the erring soul and God. It lasts
throughout our lives, it stretches even to the
end of time. If only we are men of goodwill
and have at heart our eternal interests,
we need not be disturbed at our frailty, or
at repeated lapses into sin. There is no sin
which cannot be forgiven by the sacrament
of Penance. Not that anyone, knowing
that he can be forgiven, should presume to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page078">[pg 078]</span><a name="Pg078" id="Pg078" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
abuse God's gracious sacrament, and yield
freely and without restraint to the voice of
sin; nor that we are not to be truly sorry
to the end of our days for having even once
offended our benign Maker and Redeemer;
but we must be confident that, whatever
may have been our faults and failings, however
prolonged and extraordinary our transgressions,
if we approach the sacrament of
Penance with sincere sorrow and a firm purpose
of amendment, God will always lovingly
receive us back to Himself, and remember
no more our unfaithfulness. God
hates sin, because it is opposed to Himself
and is the only evil in the world, but He
loves the wounded sinner who is made in
His own image and likeness. Precious in
the sight of God is the penitent sinner. Does
He not tell us Himself that, like a good
shepherd, He leaves ninety-nine just to go
in search of one lost sheep? Yea, He assures
us that there is rejoicing among the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page079">[pg 079]</span><a name="Pg079" id="Pg079" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
angels of Heaven over one sinner who does
penance.<a id="noteref_25" name="noteref_25" href="#note_25"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">25</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To make worthy use of the sacrament of
Penance we must be truly sorry for having
offended God, and be resolved, at the time
of confession, to do what lies in our power
never again to turn away from Him. To
these dispositions must also be joined the
intention of doing something to repair the
injury which sin has done to God. Given
such conditions, and we need only speak the
word to God's duly appointed minister and
our sins are no more. The dark veil which
hung around the soul like a cloud is lifted,
and we again rejoice in the smile of our
heavenly Father. How simple, yet how
potent are the means provided for our salvation!
None but God could have thought
of them, nothing but the love of God could
have arranged them!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But even before the sinner is brought to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page080">[pg 080]</span><a name="Pg080" id="Pg080" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
penance, even while he is wandering and
reveling afar off in the vile delights of sin,
God is pursuing him, God is seeking after
him, calling him by name, whispering to
his heart, disposing him for repentance.
We cannot return to God, once we have deserted
Him, without His help. It is our
awful power to be able to leave Him, but
to return alone we are not able. Wherefore
He comes after us when we have wandered
into the wilds of sin; He pleads as it were,
with our souls, and offers us the grace to
repent. Oh privileged are our souls to be
thus appraised by God, and happy those
who hear and heed the appealing voice of
His grace!

The shepherd country of the East is full
of walks and pathways, some leading this
way, some that. Some lead to dangerous
precipices over which the sheep might fall
and be lost, others would expose them to
the attack of wild beasts, while still others
would lead them so far astray that they
could not find their way back. It is, therefore,
always needful that the shepherd go
ahead of his flock and lead them in the right
path. The Psalmist, in the title of the
present chapter, is applying this carefulness
of the shepherd for his sheep to our Lord,
in His regard for our spiritual welfare.
The Saviour goes before us with the blessings
of His goodness to help and lead us
aright, lest perchance we become lost and
perish in our journey.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page082">[pg 082]</span><a name="Pg082" id="Pg082" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This solicitude of our Redeemer in providing
for the various needs of our souls is
characteristic of Him as Saviour. It is implied
in the meaning of his name. Before
He was born, before He was conceived in
His Mother's womb, it was foretold of Him
that He should be called Jesus, which means
Saviour, for He would save His people
from their sins.<a id="noteref_26" name="noteref_26" href="#note_26"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">26</span></span></a> He exercised, as we
know, this mission of saviour throughout
His earthly career. It was for this that He
came into the world, for this that He was
born in Bethlehem with a manger as His
cradle, for this that, at the age of twelve,
He was found teaching in the Temple, for
this that He retired to Nazareth and was
subject to Mary and Joseph, for this that
He labored and suffered and bled and died.
And with His passing from this visible
scene to the bosom of His Father, He did
not cease to be that for which He had been
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page083">[pg 083]</span><a name="Pg083" id="Pg083" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
eternally anointed—the great High Priest,
the Mediator between God and man, the
Saviour of the world. His work is everlasting;
and now that He has gone up on
high, He pleads for us ever more with the
Father. We belong to Him, He has purchased
us with His blood, and He must
needs care for our safety to the end.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Inasmuch as we are heirs, according to
divine decree, to thrones beyond the skies,
it was necessary, as we have seen, that He
who is our Saviour and Shepherd should
have left behind Him in this world of ours
a doctrine, a code, or system of instructions
and laws, which should safely direct and
guide us to our royal destiny. Those who
lived with Him on earth, those who heard
His assuring, life-giving words, and felt
the inspiration of His example and visible
presence needed not to fear for the direction
or safety of their course. The divine, living
voice and sacred presence of their Lord
and Master they enjoyed, and care and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page084">[pg 084]</span><a name="Pg084" id="Pg084" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
anxiety fled from their souls. But not for
these alone had the Redeemer come, but for
all mankind, for all who in future were to
breathe the breath of human life. He came
to save all, He died for all; and thus the
teaching which He gave to the world, and
which He committed to His chosen followers,
was for every human being, even to the
end of the world, that through it all might
live and attain to life everlasting.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The doctrine which the Saviour left us,
and the laws which He prescribed were
vastly different from the teachings of men.
Guiding, saving words of a Shepherd to his
flock, they engendered safety, comfort,
peace. Free from error or mistake, sealed
with the seal of Heaven, holding out a
promise of future glory, they exhaled the
perfumes of the eternal city, they told of
mansions not built with hands. And since
this immaculate doctrine, given for the souls
of men, was to last till the end of time, there
was need that it should be shielded against
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page085">[pg 085]</span><a name="Pg085" id="Pg085" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the assaults of the world and protected from
the influence of our changing human teachings.
It could not be corrected, because it
contained no mistakes; it could not be
changed or altered, because it came from
the changeless God; it could have no substitute
from the part of men or creatures of
any kind, because it was given by Him who
alone was the way, the truth, and the life.
Consequently the truths which the Saviour
declared to the world as the only means by
which we can be saved, were at once infallible
in themselves, and so provided for that
no human agency, no lapse of years or revolutions
of time and place should ever be
able to infringe on their eternal, changeless
character. It was to preserve these truths in
their integrity and freshness that He founded
His unerring Church and committed to
it the office of custodian and expounder, under
the guidance of His Holy Spirit, of all
He had revealed for the salvation of human
kind. Hence to hear our Shepherd's voice,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page086">[pg 086]</span><a name="Pg086" id="Pg086" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to understand what He says to us, to know
what we must do to obey His laws and save
our souls, we need but listen to the voice of
His Church. Before it was established He
declared that He should build His Church
upon a rock, and that no enemy, or group
of enemies, not even the gates of hell should
ever prevail against it.<a id="noteref_27" name="noteref_27" href="#note_27"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">27</span></span></a> He established
the Church as His mouthpiece, and He said
to the little band that constituted it in the
beginning, <span class="tei tei-q">“he that heareth you, heareth
me, and he that heareth me, heareth Him
that sent me;”</span><a id="noteref_28" name="noteref_28" href="#note_28"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">28</span></span></a> and, as if to emphasize this
declaration, He added that any one who
would not hear and obey the Church should
be considered as a heathen and a publican—types
of all that was bad.<a id="noteref_29" name="noteref_29" href="#note_29"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">29</span></span></a> The Church,
therefore, is the oracle of God, it is His
mouthpiece; it possesses and guards the only
revelation which God has made to His rational
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page087">[pg 087]</span><a name="Pg087" id="Pg087" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
creatures; it alone has the words of
eternal life.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus it is that our divine Shepherd goes
before us, leading us in the paths of truth
and justice, preserving us from danger and
error with respect to our spiritual destiny.
We cannot go astray if we listen to Him
speaking to us through His church. In
all our perplexities and uncertainties,
when confronted by any doubt, or confused
and distracted by the wrangling
voices and conflicting opinions of men, we
can be calm and at peace, assured in our
inmost souls that the voice which guides us
cannot err, that it is easier for heaven and
earth to pass away than for one word of His
to fail.<a id="noteref_30" name="noteref_30" href="#note_30"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">30</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He leadeth me in ways of justice, in the
ways of holiness, in the ways which the
saints have walked. How exceeding great,
indeed, is our privilege, and how certain

and individual our election! All that remains

follow Him, and present peace will attend
our labors, while future glory waits upon
our end.

But in the midst of abundant blessings
and spiritual favors which have surrounded
and sheltered us from infancy, we are apt
to be unmindful of our state of plenty and
forgetful of the duty of gratitude. We are
apt to venture out like thoughtless children,
trusting in our own strength to battle with
the foe; or else, on the contrary, we sluggishly
presume that a bountiful Providence
will provide for us regardless of our own
co-operation. We have never known what
it is to want for spiritual food and spiritual
direction, except when indolence, careless
indifference, and our own folly have led
us astray. These are evils which continually
assail us, and we often make friends
with them, not knowing what we are doing
for the most part, until the blood of life has
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page089">[pg 089]</span><a name="Pg089" id="Pg089" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
almost ebbed away. We are not, indeed,
removed from a world where sin abounds
and where deceiving voices may allure us
this way and that. Like the pastoral country
of the Orient, the walks of life are
fraught with perils: false teachers, false
doctrines, false prophets, pseudo-christs;<a id="noteref_31" name="noteref_31" href="#note_31"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">31</span></span></a>

The doctrine and truths which Christ
taught and which He entrusted to His
Church are set aside or explained away by
these modern teachers, and the novel and

and unwary sheep have been lost to
the fold of Christ by following the call of
these unworthy preachers and false shepherds!
What multitudes of precious souls
have been deceived by their polished words

This poisoning of the soul and the heart
by erroneous doctrines is effected in many
and diverse ways; the victims of falsehood
are variously captured. There are the wisdom
and sagacity of men, there are the conquests
of science and the learning of the

strides of history, the breakdown and overthrow
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page091">[pg 091]</span><a name="Pg091" id="Pg091" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of many things held sacred by our
forefathers—and all these changes and ruptures
in the order of a former generation
are now used to beguile the flock of Christ
and sway them from the paths of truth
and righteousness. But amid all this din
and uproar of conflicting voices, amid the
wrangling tumult and confusion of converging
opinions, those who will may hear
and discern the loving voice of the true
Shepherd speaking to the world through
His Church with the same calm, assuring
words which He uttered to living witnesses
two thousand years ago. He has not

not deserted His chosen flock, but is with it

reflect that this abiding faithfulness of our
Saviour in caring for our wants is not from
any worthiness of ours, or because of our

the Shadow of Death, I Will Fear
no Evil, for Thou Art With Me.</span></h1>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Besides the paths and dangerous walks in
the shepherd country that would lead the
sheep to destruction and death, there are
other paths all encompassed with evils
through which, nevertheless, they are at
times obliged to make their way. Safety
from all harm there cannot be for the shepherd's
flock. They must in their journeys
encounter many perils, even while pursuing
the proper paths. There are deep and darksome
valleys, walled round on all sides by
towering rocky hills, which at times the
shepherd cannot easily escape. And within
these shadowy valleys and somber ravines
there dwell not infrequently wild and
ferocious animals that will, if aroused, attack
and kill the tender sheep. The utmost
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page094">[pg 094]</span><a name="Pg094" id="Pg094" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
care and caution of the shepherd are called
into service safely to conduct his dependent
flock through these places of deepest peril.
But in spite of all his watchfulness it sometimes
happens that a wolf will get into the
very midst of the sheep. The timid, terrified
animals become wild with fright, and
are scattered, running this way and that,
until the shepherd calls and bids them collect
together. No sooner do they hear his
voice, than they all rush swiftly together in
a solid mass, and either drive the enemy
from their midst or cripple and crush him
to death.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus in times of greatest peril the shepherd
protects his sheep, and wrests them
from the jaws of harm. The sheep know
this, and they fear no evils; they know that
their master is with them. Yea, though
they walk in the shadow of perils and dwell
in the midst of the valley of death, they
faint not, neither do they fear, for they know
that the shepherd is near.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page095">[pg 095]</span><a name="Pg095" id="Pg095" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The case of the sheep in the valley of
perils is not unlike our own in the midst of
the evils of the world; and the peace and
safety which we enjoy should be similar
also to theirs. We are assured, first of all,
by an unflinching faith in God and our Redeemer
that, if we trust our Master and
obey Him, we shall be led aright throughout
our lives, even to the kingdom of
Heaven. We shall be led in the paths of
justice and love, and crowned at length with
the crown of glory, if we but follow the
voice of our Shepherd-King, and avoid the
walks of disaster and ruin. And to hear
His voice and to know it we have but to
listen to the teachings of His Church, which
will hush to silence our troubled hearts, and
direct our wayward feet into the paths of
heavenly peace.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But, like the shepherd's flock, we have to
avoid in our journey through life, as perils
to our safety and spiritual welfare, not only
the false shepherds and teachers and doctrines
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page096">[pg 096]</span><a name="Pg096" id="Pg096" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that surround us on all sides; but we
must also, to pass to our reward, actually
encounter inevitable evils and fight many
necessary battles. Many of the paths of
life through which we must of necessity
pass are hard and difficult, and full of deadly
perils. We must remember that sin has
ruined the primeval beauty of our earthly
habitation and made our life here below a
labor and a toil to the end.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We not only come into the world with sin
on our souls, and are thereby exiles from
the city of God, but even when our sin is
forgiven us the remains of the malady continue
as wounds in our nature as long as we
live on earth. The deadly guilt is wiped
away, but the effects of the evil remain.
And it is chiefly these wounds of our nature,
in ourselves and in others, that render life's
journey, even when pursued in accordance
with the law of God, at times truly difficult
and perilous. Fidelity to God and to His
law is not always a safeguard against the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page097">[pg 097]</span><a name="Pg097" id="Pg097" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
wickedness of the world and of men; at
times, in fact, it is just the contrary. Indeed,
is it not a truth that many, perhaps
the majority, of those who endeavor sincerely
to please and to serve God must often
suffer severely for their very goodness and
faithfulness? Are they not misunderstood,
and criticised, and censured? Are they not
frequently accused of all manner of wrong,
their work disparaged, and their motives
impugned? Are not persecution, and even
martyrdom, often their portion? Now all
this is the result of sin. Those who call
into question the deeds and motives of God's
saints; those who upbraid, and criticise, and
impute evil to the sincere, faithful servants
of God, inflicting upon them dire evils, are
but showing the effects of sin in themselves,
are but giving exercise to the evil that rules
within them. Their particular acts and
words may be without present malice, they
may be inwardly persuaded that in reviling
and condemning their neighbor and doing
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page098">[pg 098]</span><a name="Pg098" id="Pg098" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
him harm, they are rendering a service to
God Himself; but in so doing they but
manifest the effects of earlier sin, personal,
perhaps, and original, which has darkened
their understanding and made perverse
their moral vision, so that, having eyes, they
see not, having ears, they hear not, neither
do they understand.<a id="noteref_35" name="noteref_35" href="#note_35"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">35</span></span></a> Following the corruption
of their own nature, bleeding from
the wounds of original sin, they are prone to
blaspheme whatsoever they fail to comprehend;<a id="noteref_36" name="noteref_36" href="#note_36"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">36</span></span></a>
and thus it is that they often make
life and the world for the servant of God a
truly perilous sojourn, a veritable valley of
death.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This failure to be understood, this misjudgment
of actions, motives, deeds, are
doubtless common evils from which, in a
measure, we all must suffer. But it is also
true that the more elevated the life, the
higher its aims, the loftier the spiritual level
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page099">[pg 099]</span><a name="Pg099" id="Pg099" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
on which it proceeds, the greater the difficulty
of its being understood and appreciated
by the majority, who always tread the
common paths of mediocrity. A saint is
nearly always a disturbance to his immediate
surroundings, he is frequently an annoyance
and an irritation to the little circle in
which his external life is cast, simply because
he really lives and moves in a sphere
which the ordinary life cannot grasp. Like
a brilliant, dazzling light that obscures the
lesser luminaries, and is therefore odious to
them, the man of God is frequently a disturber
to the worldly peace of common men,
his life and works are a living reproach to
their life and works; and hence, without
willing it, he becomes a menace to their
society and is not welcome in their company.
Worldly, plotting minds cannot understand
the spiritual and the holy; sinful
souls are out of harmony with the virtuous;
the children of darkness cannot find peace
with the children of light. And not only
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page100">[pg 100]</span><a name="Pg100" id="Pg100" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
is there a lack of sympathy in the worldly-minded
for the men and women who are
led of God, but there is often positive hatred
for them—a hatred which spends itself in
actual, persistent persecution. To be devout,
to refrain from sinful words and sinful
deeds, to shun the vain and dangerous
amusements of worldlings, to attend much
to prayer and recollection, to love the house
and worship of God, to be seen often approaching
the sacraments and partaking of
the bread of life at the communion rail—even
these holy acts are sufficient frequently
to draw down on the servants of God the
curse and persecution of a world which
knows not what it does.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And that which happens individually to
the faithful children of God takes place on
a larger scale with respect to God's Church.
The children of this world, those who have
set their heart on temporal things, or who,
through wilful error have deviated from
the right path to things eternal, never cease
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page101">[pg 101]</span><a name="Pg101" id="Pg101" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
from pursuing and persecuting the Church
of God. They hate the Church and attack
it unceasingly. Like the perverse and
blinded Jews of old who reviled the Saviour
and His words and deeds, who pursued
Him and put Him to death, these ever-living
and ever-active enemies of light and
truth never abate in their fury against the
chosen friends of Christ, and against His
holy Church. But need we be surprised at
this? Was it not foretold? Did not our
blessed Shepherd, speaking in the beginning
to His little flock, warn them that men
would deliver them up in councils and
scourge them? Did He not say to them
plainly, <span class="tei tei-q">“And you shall be hated by all men
for my name's sake; but he that shall persevere
unto the end, he shall be saved. And
when they persecute you in this city, flee
into another.... The disciple is not
above the master, nor the servant above his
lord. It is enough for the disciple that he
be as his master, and the servant as his lord.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page102">[pg 102]</span><a name="Pg102" id="Pg102" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
If they have called the good man of the
house Beelzebub, how much more them of
his household.”</span><a id="noteref_37" name="noteref_37" href="#note_37"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">37</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It happens, therefore, that fidelity to God,
and careful adherence to the paths of justice
and holiness, can frequently be the occasion
of perils and sufferings for us individually,
as they also are the excuse for a
vaster persecution of the Church in general.
All holy persons and holy things are signs
of contradiction. They are not of the world,
they do not fit in with it; and between them
and the world there will be strife and contention
until the renovation comes.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But the enemies that lie along the ways
of life, that beset and threaten even the most
righteous paths of our pilgrimage, are not
all from without—the most numerous and
menacing are perhaps from within. <span class="tei tei-q">“The
enemies of a man,”</span> says the inspired writer,
<span class="tei tei-q">“are those of his own household.”</span><a id="noteref_38" name="noteref_38" href="#note_38"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">38</span></span></a> That
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page103">[pg 103]</span><a name="Pg103" id="Pg103" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
is to say, the most potent evils which we
suffer, the chiefest foes to our present and
future welfare are from ourselves—our own
waywardness, our tendencies to evil, our
wilfulness, our self-love and self-seeking,
our own sins. It is from these and like
causes that we suffer most. Hard and trying
it surely is to bear persecutions and contradictions
from others; severe is the strain
to nature when, in the face of our noblest
efforts, proceeding from noblest motives, we
meet with misunderstanding and even condemnation;
but to the upright, religious
heart that is sincerely and truly seeking God
amid the shadows and pitfalls of life, the
sorest of all trials and the fiercest of all enemies
are one's own temptations and passions
and inclinations to evil. Easier it were to
conquer the whole external world of foes,
than to reign supreme over the little world
within. Of Alexander the Great it is said,
that while he actually subdued the whole
known world of his time, he nevertheless
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page104">[pg 104]</span><a name="Pg104" id="Pg104" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
yielded in defeat before his own passions.
He could overcome his external enemies,
but surrendered miserably in the battle with
self.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This, then, is our greatest warfare, the
struggle with ourselves; and this our greatest
victory, a triumph over self. <span class="tei tei-q">“If each
year,”</span> says the Imitation, <span class="tei tei-q">“we could uproot
but one evil inclination, how soon we should
be perfect men!”</span><a id="noteref_39" name="noteref_39" href="#note_39"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">39</span></span></a> But it is not for us to
be free from enemies and perils, both from
without and from within, during our earthly
sojourn. They are a part of our lot here
below, they are necessarily bound up with
the darkened regions through which the
Shepherd must lead his flock; and hence,
entire safety there shall never be before the
journey's end, until we say farewell to present
woes, and hail <span class="tei tei-q">“the happy fields, where
joy forever dwells.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In our present state, therefore, it is important
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page105">[pg 105]</span><a name="Pg105" id="Pg105" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
for us to realize our dangers and to
be prepared for conflict. There is no way
of escape from crosses, and perils, and
dreadful battles for all those who wish to
win the crown of victory. They must follow
the Shepherd as he leads the way, and
hence our Lord has said, <span class="tei tei-q">“if any man will
come after me, let him take up his cross
daily and follow me.”</span><a id="noteref_40" name="noteref_40" href="#note_40"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">40</span></span></a> Yes, it is the following
of the Shepherd, it is his leadership,
his constant presence, that give comfort to
the sheep, and dispel the dread and fear of
perils. And though we pass through the
valley and shadow of death, we need fear
no evil, for He is with us. At times, frequently
perhaps, as we sail the sea of life,
the waves roll over and deluge us so completely
that we are all but smothered. The
clouds gather, thick and black, and overcast
the sky of our souls; the sorrows of
death surround us, and the pains of the pit
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page106">[pg 106]</span><a name="Pg106" id="Pg106" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
encompass us;<a id="noteref_41" name="noteref_41" href="#note_41"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">41</span></span></a> we are overwhelmed with
sadness and plunged in darkness. We think
of God, we remember Him, but He seems
afar off. The evil which weighs us down—the
pain of body, the agony of soul, the sadness
and dejection of heart and mind, <span class="tei tei-q">“the
madness that worketh in the brain,”</span> muffle
the voice and all but still the trembling
pulse, and we are not able so much as to lift
our drooping heads and tear-dimmed eyes
to see the gentle Shepherd standing faithfully
at our side. It is our failure to discern
and apprehend Him that causes extreme
agony. If at these times of utter desolation,
when the soul is swept by the winds
of sorrow, we could only raise our eyes and
thoughts to Him, with faith and hope and
child-like trust, the spell would be broken;
and we should see the clouds lift and part
and float away on the wind, only to let in
God's cheerful sun to raise the drooping
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page107">[pg 107]</span><a name="Pg107" id="Pg107" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
spirit, and warm and soothe the troubled
soul.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But it is difficult, when oppressed by sorrow
and affliction, to lift the heart and mind
to things above. Nature of itself tends
downward, and unless it has learned to discipline
itself and to engage with the enemy
in sturdy battle, it is not yet prepared for
life. For the world is a battlefield and life
a warfare, even from a natural point of
view, and only they can hope to win in life's
hard contest who have learned to brave the
battle, who have prepared themselves for
conflict. But who is ready for the struggle,
and how shall we be able to encounter our
foes? Left to ourselves and to our own resources,
we shall surely go down in defeat.
The opposing forces are too gigantic, too
numerous. They throng from near and
from afar. They swarm from within and
from without; from our own nature and from
others, from the world around, and from
our own household; from those at home,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page108">[pg 108]</span><a name="Pg108" id="Pg108" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and from them that are abroad. Frequently
during life we are, of a certainty, encompassed
round with perils; we hardly know
where to turn or what to do, we are breathless
with fright; but even then, if we have
proper faith, we shall grow calm, like the
shepherd's flock in the midst of devouring
animals and beasts of prey, for our Saviour
and Shepherd is with us, and no evil can befall
us. Even when we think Him farthest,
He is often nearest; when we think Him
sleeping, His heart is watching. He loves
us, His weak and timid sheep; we are the
objects of His heart's affection and ever
active solicitude; He will not let perish, if
we trust Him, the price of His precious
Blood.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And the training we are to receive,
and the preparation we are to make, in
order worthily and victoriously to engage
in the battle of life are nothing,
therefore, but lessons of love and trust in
the constant goodness and faithfulness of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page109">[pg 109]</span><a name="Pg109" id="Pg109" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
our divine Saviour. Unless we viciously
drive Him away by deliberate, grievous
sin, He is really never absent from us, and
least of all when we need Him most. It is
our fault, if we do not by faith discern Him,
if we do not feel His ever-gracious presence.
We need to discipline ourselves in
acts and deeds of faith and love, and then
we shall realize that He is always near us,
even in the darkness of the shadow of death.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We must try to know our Shepherd, first
of all; we must endeavor intimately to understand
Him. For to have faith in Him,
to trust Him, to believe in His power and
goodness, in His overruling care for us and
our interests, presuppose a knowledge of
Him, just as faith and confidence in an
earthly friend follow upon an intimate acquaintance
with that friend. But this close
knowledge of our Master, so necessary to
our present peace and future happiness, will
never be ours unless we make Him our confidant,
unless we accustom ourselves to live
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page110">[pg 110]</span><a name="Pg110" id="Pg110" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in His presence, to look to Him, to speak
to Him often, to listen to His gracious direction.
And this intimate relationship
with our Saviour, this habitual communion
with Him, will enkindle in our souls the
fire of love. Once we know Him, we will
trust Him, and having faith and confidence
in Him, we will link our poor lives to His
divine life by the strong cords of heavenly
charity. Fear and uncertainty will then be

It is love, above all, that directs our life—love,
indeed, which is born of knowledge.
We do not, it is true, love anything before
we have some knowledge of it; this
would be an impossibility; but once the
soul has caught the vision, it is love that
drives the life and stimulates and enriches
the knowledge. The objects of our
affections are the interpreters of our life and
actions. If we love the world, we are led
by the world; if we love God, it is God
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page111">[pg 111]</span><a name="Pg111" id="Pg111" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

its way. But if God is the object of our
love, we shall fear no evil; for <span class="tei tei-q">“God is
charity,”</span> says St. John, <span class="tei tei-q">“and he that abideth
in charity, abideth in God, and God in
him ... Fear is not in charity; but
perfect charity casteth out fear, because
fear hath pain.”</span><a id="noteref_43" name="noteref_43" href="#note_43"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">43</span></span></a>

It is only the love of God, therefore, that
will steady our lives, and bear us up in the
thick of tribulations. It is the confident
assurance that we, although so unworthy,
are the objects of divine complacency that
awakens in our hearts a return of burning
charity, and enables us to say, with the
Psalmist, when the day is darkest <span class="tei tei-q">“The
Lord is my light and salvation; whom shall
I fear? The Lord is the protector of my

our Master, if armed with the gift of His
love, <span class="tei tei-q">“for fear hath pain, but love casteth
out fear.”</span> Rather shall we, like the martyrs
of old, mindful of the gift of God, go
bravely forth to the battle of life, or to the
slaughter, calmly, hopefully, cheerfully.
While humbly, but steadfastly trustful of
the Shepherd that leads us, we shall not be
disturbed or troubled; the present shall be
shorn of its terrors, the future of its forebodings.
This truly is the triumph of life,
when love, not fear, has come to rule us.
This is the broader, larger life—the forerunner
of life eternal in which our days are
passed in calm serenity—in which we press
on with undaunted tread, alike under
frowning clouds, or under a star-lit sky;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page113">[pg 113]</span><a name="Pg113" id="Pg113" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
alike with the joys of friendship around us,
or alone amidst the graves of the dead.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We must not infer from this that the love
of God which is our strength, the source of
our courage, will blunt our feelings or harden
our lives. It does not seal up the fountain
of tears, or make us insensible to the pains
and sorrows of life, which belong to the lot
of all. In a certain sense it is likely true
that those suffer most in life who are most
united to God; for they feel most the coldness
of the world and its desolation, its want
of love and sympathy, its degradation and
its misery. Hence it would be a mistake
to think that the friends of God in this life
are either exempted from pain and sorrow,
or made insensible to them, either in themselves
or in others. Of these and other
evils they are truly more keenly aware than
worldly men, if for no other reason than
because of the superior refinement of their
nature and the spiritual outlook of their
vision. It is sin, after all, that hardens
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page114">[pg 114]</span><a name="Pg114" id="Pg114" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
while it weakens. Sin closes the heart to
love, it renders its victims cold, unsympathetic
and selfish; whereas the gifts of grace
and holiness are tenderness, mercy, strength.
But though all have to suffer, both the holy
and the unholy, the difference between them
is this, that the ungodly are borne down
and overcome by their sorrows and crosses,
while the spiritual are always triumphing
even in the midst of apparent defeat. To
the foolish they seem to be vanquished, yet
they conquer; often they seem on the verge
of surrender, when they emerge in victory;
they seem to die, when behold they live!<a id="noteref_46" name="noteref_46" href="#note_46"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">46</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The spiritual man, then, does suffer; he
suffers in the cause of God; he suffers for
others and for himself. More than this, it
is doubtless true that he feels his crosses
more keenly, he grieves more profoundly,
than do the children of the world; but
through it all he remembers his Saviour
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page115">[pg 115]</span><a name="Pg115" id="Pg115" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is already plain to us that the sorrows
and sufferings of the present life are, without
doubt, the result and consequence of
sin. That we should pass our mortal days
so full of pain and tears, that our fellow-man,
that the beasts of the field and the elements,
which we need and use as helpers
and servants, and most of all that our own
nature, with its passions and evil tendencies,
should rise up against us and oppose us, was
assuredly not a part of the original plan.
As a wise and all-powerful Designer and
Creator, God founded the world after a
masterful fashion—devoid of evil, free from
defect, perfect according to the plans
framed in Heaven. The hills and mountains
He founded and set on their bases; the
streams and rivers and valleys He formed,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page117">[pg 117]</span><a name="Pg117" id="Pg117" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
all rich and lovely, intended for the comfort
and happiness of man; the blue deep
He constructed and beautified with its millions
of shining wonders; and in all these
stupendous creations, in all the diverse
works of His mighty, omnipotent hands
there was in the beginning no trace of fault,
of defect, of error or sin. The upheaval
came when man disobeyed and wrought the
commencement of all our woe. And hence
it is to man's first disobedience and the fruit
of that forbidden tree, that we owe all the
evils from which our nature suffers and to
which our flesh is heir.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But although we know the source of our
sorrows and feel the guilt of our sins, this
does not make our burden lighter or shorten
the path of our pilgrimage. We are confronted
by the problem of labor and suffering
as soon as we enter the world. No one
is entirely exempted; and, strange as it is,
we see that it frequently happens, that those
are most afflicted who are farthest removed
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page118">[pg 118]</span><a name="Pg118" id="Pg118" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
from the wickedness of the world and purest
in the sight of God. <span class="tei tei-q">“Many are the
tribulations of the just;”</span> and how true is it
that the very fidelity of the servants of God
is often an occasion of their sufferings! It
is not wonderful that sorrow and fear
should be the portion of sinners throughout
the length of their days, for <span class="tei tei-q">“contrition and
unhappiness are in their ways, and the way
of peace they have not known;”</span><a id="noteref_48" name="noteref_48" href="#note_48"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">48</span></span></a> but that
all, even the saints of God, should suffer
alike and be oppressed with miseries is, at
first sight, a problem and a baffling mystery.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is something, indeed, to feel in our suffering
that we are paying the debt of our
sins, whether personal, or original, or both;
it is much to know that our crosses, severe
and inevitable as they are, are a curb to our
wayward nature, and a restraint against
further sins; it is assuredly a great privilege
and a high honor that we, unworthy
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page119">[pg 119]</span><a name="Pg119" id="Pg119" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and unfaithful servants of our Master,
should, through our tears and sorrows and
sufferings, be enabled to conform our poor
lives to the tearful and sorrowful life of our
Saviour; it is a comfort that words cannot
tell to be assured by our faith that in the
midst of pains and perils the Shepherd of
our souls is ever near to shield, to guard,
and to save—all this is surely much—enough
to encourage and strengthen us daily
to take up our cross and joyfully follow our
Redeemer, even to the hill of Calvary, even
to the death of the cross. But this is not
all. A deeper meaning lies hidden behind
the veil of tears, beneath the cloak of pain
and sorrow. The miseries of life are not a
mere inheritance, neither is their value of a
purely negative character. We instinctively
feel that somehow, somewhere beyond the
scope of mortal ken, there is a higher explanation
and a more valid justification for all
the failures and pains and sorrows of life,
than that which appears on the surface of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page120">[pg 120]</span><a name="Pg120" id="Pg120" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
things, or issues in results that are only negative.
Suffering for its own sake was never
intended; and we were not made to suffer.
We were not created for misery, but for
happiness; not for failure, but for victory;
not for death, but for life; not for time, but
for eternity. And hence there is a deeper
meaning, a higher explanation for all the
failures and miseries of the present life than
those that are apparent to the casual observer.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the title of this chapter the Psalmist,
referring to the shepherd's care for his
sheep, says: <span class="tei tei-q">“Thy rod and thy staff, they
comfort me.”</span> The staff the shepherd uses,
as already explained, is to assist the sheep
along their perilous journeys, and the rod
to protect them in case of attack. The rod
and the staff are necessary for the welfare
of the flock, necessary to guide and shield
them in their wanderings, and to bring
them safely home. So too, it is with us, the
children of God. To be properly protected
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page121">[pg 121]</span><a name="Pg121" id="Pg121" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

of the rod of affliction and adversity, and
likewise of the staff of mercy.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Although human miseries—pain, poverty,
suffering and death—are, as we know,
the consequences, just and equitable, of
original sin, it is a shortsighted faith and
a defective vision that find in these crosses
only chastisement for sin. Truly, they
should not have been, had we never sinned;
but as God, in His mercy, draws good out of
evil, so has He made these inevitable results
of our transgression serve a higher purpose
and minister to noble ends. The Saviour
came that we might have life, that we might
progress and advance to ever fuller and
more abundant life.<a id="noteref_49" name="noteref_49" href="#note_49"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">49</span></span></a> His aim, and the
aim and purpose of His heavenly Father,
since the very dawn of our creation, has
been to lead us to happiness—to perfect,
abundant, eternal happiness. It would be
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page122">[pg 122]</span><a name="Pg122" id="Pg122" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of little account to be happy here, unless
we are also to rejoice eternally. It would
be a poor exchange and a paltry satisfaction,
to be present at the feasts of men, only to
forfeit our place at the banquet of angels.
But our heavenly reward and our celestial
crown are to be merited and won here below;
they are to follow upon our earthly
labors. <span class="tei tei-q">“Only he shall be crowned,”</span> says
St. Paul, <span class="tei tei-q">“who has legitimately engaged in
the battle.”</span><a id="noteref_50" name="noteref_50" href="#note_50"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">50</span></span></a> And did not the Master say
Himself, <span class="tei tei-q">“Let him who wishes to come
after me deny himself and take up his cross
and follow me?”</span><a id="noteref_51" name="noteref_51" href="#note_51"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">51</span></span></a> Did He not declare that
we must die to live? that we must surrender
our life here, if we would keep it eternally?
<span class="tei tei-q">“Amen, amen, I say to you, unless the grain
of wheat falling into the ground die, itself
remaineth alone. But if it die it bringeth
forth much fruit. He that loveth his life
shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page123">[pg 123]</span><a name="Pg123" id="Pg123" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
this world, keepeth it unto life eternal.”</span><a id="noteref_52" name="noteref_52" href="#note_52"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">52</span></span></a>
We cannot serve two masters, we cannot
serve God and mammon. If we would
seek to avoid all pain and sorrow, and spend
our lives in the pleasures of sense, we must
be prepared to forego the future joys of the
soul; if we would pass our days indulging
the flesh and chasing the phantoms of time,
we must needs make ready for the death of
the spirit and the forfeit of all that is lasting.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We have no choice, then; if we would
succeed eternally, we must follow the way
of the cross. This is the only way to life—to
that abundant, celestial life which our
Creator has wished us to live. And it is
the bearing of our cross, patiently and resignedly
to the will of God, together with
our other good works, that enables us to
merit, in so far as we can, the joys of the
kingdom of Heaven. But the sufferings
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page124">[pg 124]</span><a name="Pg124" id="Pg124" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and labors, so inevitable and necessary to
our earthly state, which serve as a means to
supernal rewards, have still another, deeper
meaning, and serve another purpose. We
cannot evade them, we must encounter them.
They are not only unavoidable, but necessary
to our dearest interests, as we see, since
they are strewn as thorns and brambles all
along the narrow way that leads to eternal
life. We cannot choose them or lay them
aside at will. We may, indeed, if we be
foolish and impious enough, refuse to walk
the narrow way of the just and choose the
broad road that leadeth to destruction; but
we shall not even thus escape the pains and
perils inseparable from this mortal life. Or
again, we may, in our folly, rebel against
the crosses and labors that confront and
pursue us; but whether we go this way or
that, whether we will it or not, we can no
more eschew all the evils of life than escape
from the air that we breathe. The pressure,
it is true, is not always upon us; we
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page125">[pg 125]</span><a name="Pg125" id="Pg125" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
are not, without ceasing, weighed down by
our labors and groaning to be delivered
from the body of this death. There is interruption,
there is passing pleasure, a rift
in the clouds and a smile of the sunshine
even for the darkest and poorest life. And
yet withal, we know and we are conscious
that we are ever under the sentence of death,
that life is a fleeting shadow, that like

frequently it finds its solution in unbridled
self-indulgence, in mental unbalance, and
self-destruction! But the saints, and all
the truly wise, have viewed the problem of
human suffering in a vastly different light.
They have discerned it, first of all, as really
distinctive of the road to Heaven, and as
essentially pertaining to the royal way of
the cross. They have understood that it
extinguishes the wrath of the heavenly
Father, that it atones for sin and makes the
soul conformable to our suffering Saviour,
and therefore have they loved it. And
more than this, those who have been led by
the wisdom of God have found, not only
that the crosses of life are essentially connected
with the way of salvation, but that
by them and through them alone we are
often <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">positively driven</span></em> to God. We may
try to avoid them, and at times, perhaps,
succeed; we may flee from them or endeavor
to still the voice of their pain; or, when
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page127">[pg 127]</span><a name="Pg127" id="Pg127" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
unable to escape them, we may, in our wrath
and desperation, rise up against them and
rebuke them: but they persistently remain,
they continue to haunt, as if to woo and to
win us to penetrate their deeper meaning,
and discover the treasure that in them lies
concealed. The very breakdown of human
things, the severing of human ties and relationships,
the loss of health and wealth, of
treasures and friends, and of all that life
holds dear, are really meant, in the deepest
sense, to drive us to the divine. This is the
meaning of those tears and sorrows, those
pains and sufferings, that loneliness, that
grief, that agony of heart and soul which
belong to this world of tears. All these are
intended to teach us that here below, on
this crumbling shore of time, we have no
abiding city, or home, or life, or love; but
seek a city, a home, a life, a love that hath
foundations, whose builder and maker is

We need God, we were made for God,
and our nature, with all its longings and
powers, cries out for Him. And therefore
has God so arranged the world, in spite of
all its evils, and in spite of all our sinfulness,

lead us out to happiness—lead us out to
Himself. It was our sin that despoiled the
face of the world; but God, in His mercy,
has drawn good out of evil, He has made
the effects of sin minister to our advantage,
if we will but have it so. We may, forsooth,
refuse, because we are free; we may
object, and rebel, and oppose our lot; we
may take our destiny out of the hands of

are directed by grace and light from above
are able to pierce the deeper meaning of
the cross. All have to bear it, but not all

all do not know the power of it. Like fortune,
it knocks at every door, into every
heart it endeavors to enter and make known
its deeper significance, its hidden secrets,

sorrow which bind us here below, our Shepherd
thus would turn to golden cords of
love, which draw and hold us to Himself.
We cannot, as we see, ascend to Heaven,
rise to blessedness, except by the way of the
cross. And our degree of glory in Heaven,
the eternal happiness which we shall enjoy,
will be in proportion to the degree of charity
or love of God which our souls possess
at death; and this divine charity, which is
to measure our future beatitude, is acquired
and augmented by faithfully doing the will
of God—by patiently and lovingly bearing
the cross of life. Sacrifice is the test of love.
And hence the more we do and suffer for
Christ's sake, the more we prove our love
for Him and the greater shall be our happiness
in the kingdom of His Father. All
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page133">[pg 133]</span><a name="Pg133" id="Pg133" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
holy writers, all the masters of the spiritual
life agree in teaching that God particularly
chastises those whom He loves with a special
love. He proves the elect to find if
they are worthy of Himself.<a id="noteref_59" name="noteref_59" href="#note_59"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">59</span></span></a> He does not
spare them now, that He may spare them
hereafter; He tries them for a time, that
He may reward them forever; He seems
harsh with them here, during the time of
probation, only that He may draw them
closer to Himself everlastingly.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The devoted friends of God and the ardent
lovers of things spiritual have deeply
pondered these momentous truths. They
have realized that our days here, though
few and fast-flying, are really to determine
our lot and condition throughout the eternal
years. They have known that the passing
present is the price of the lasting future;
that this is the seeding time, and hereafter
the harvest. And because our future happiness
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page134">[pg 134]</span><a name="Pg134" id="Pg134" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
is to be in accord with our merits
here acquired, jealously have they sought
and embraced every present occasion to increase
their merits and their worthiness for
the glory that is to come. This is why they
have loved the cross, the symbol of salvation,
the emblem of victory; this, too, is why
they have felt disturbed and full of fear
when the cross was absent from them. Unlike
the unenlightened sufferer, who sees
only punishment in his pains, the saints of
God have ever accepted their crosses as a
sign of special love, a divine visitation, a
preparation for the great communion.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We see now how it is that the rod of chastisement
and the staff of mercy are able to
give joy and comfort to God's chosen
friends; and thus are they designed to console
and comfort everyone who is truly led
by faith and love. Sufferings are really a
blessing, but the eye of faith alone discerns
it. They keep us from present pleasures,
from hurtful occasions, from alluring vanities;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page135">[pg 135]</span><a name="Pg135" id="Pg135" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
they direct us into the way of salvation,
they drive us to God, they increase the
glory of our eternal blessedness. What are
the trials of earth when compared with the
joys of Heaven? Rather, how precious are
they! since, if we use them aright, they lead
us out into a higher life, to a closer friendship
with God. And if, through the mercy
of our heavenly Father, we permit the cross
to lead us to His knees and enrich our lives
with His love, who can speak its infinite
value? What treasure can be likened to it?
Surely nothing that we know can surpass it
in worth. We might, indeed, enjoy all that
life can give; we might possess all riches,
all health, all success; we might have honor,
fame, glory, power; the praise and love of
men, the treasures of earthly friendship and
earthly affection—the whole world we
might gain and enjoy; but if through all
these, or in spite of all, we should not be led
to the love and friendship of God, we
should know only vanity, and life for us
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page136">[pg 136]</span><a name="Pg136" id="Pg136" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
would in its issue be nothing but a dismal
failure.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But if, on the contrary, through the sufferings
and losses, the deficiencies and limitations
of life, we have been led to make
God our dearest friend, if we have been
taught, by the coldness and harshness of
men, to take refuge in His love, how blessed
are we! how cheaply the purchase has been
made, even though it has meant the loss of
every passing good, of all that the world can
give, even the pouring out of our own life's
blood!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Teach me, O my Master, in the day of
sorrow and tribulation, to understand the
meaning of the cross, to know the value of
my sufferings, to grasp the power and the
secret of Thy rod and Thy staff. Assist me
to see Thee through the darkness that surrounds
me; and give me to feel, in the midst
of loneliness and perils, amid pain and desolation,
the nearness to my soul of Thy loving-kindness,
and the strength of Thy merciful
presence.

the Presence of Mine Enemies.</span></h1>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the preceding verses of the Shepherd
Psalm the Psalmist has described the constant
care of the shepherd for his sheep—the
rest and refreshment, the protection and
comfort he provides for them. And now,
in the present verse, he speaks of a feast he
has prepared for them, which is to be likened
to a bountiful banquet—a banquet
which they are to enjoy, a feast which they
are to consume, in the sight of their enemies,
in the presence of the evils that afflict them.
He refers, at first, to the manner of preparing
or spreading a table in the Orient.
Often the custom of olden times was not
much different from that which prevails
among the Arabs even today. To prepare
a table means with them simply to spread
a skin or a cloth or a mat on the ground.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page138">[pg 138]</span><a name="Pg138" id="Pg138" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And it is to this kind of table that the
Psalmist refers when he sings of the feast
of the sheep. He means nothing more than
that he has provided for his flock in the
face of their enemies a rich pasture, a
spreading slope, where they shall feed with
contentment and peace, in spite of the evils
that surround them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But the quiet and peace which the sheep
enjoy, while partaking of their spread-out
banquet, are entirely owing to the protecting
presence of the shepherd. And it frequently
happens that here again the utmost
skill and diligence of the shepherd are
called into play in thus securing the peace
and safety of his flock. The most abundant
pastures are many times interspersed with
noxious weeds and plants, which, if eaten,
would sicken and poison the herd; while
around the feeding places and grazing
grounds very often lie hid, in thickets and
holes and caves in the hillsides, wild animals,
such as jackals, wolves and panthers,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page139">[pg 139]</span><a name="Pg139" id="Pg139" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
ready to spring out, at the critical moment,
and devour the innocent sheep. The shepherd
is aware of all these evils and enemies
of his tender flock; and he goes ahead and
prepares the way, avoiding the poisonous
grasses, and driving away, or slaying, if
need be, the beasts that menace the peace
and security of the pasture. The evils are
not entirely dispelled, but only sufficiently
removed or held in check so as not to imperil
the flock.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Such is the table prepared for the sheep
by their provident and watchful shepherd;
and such is the feast of which they partake
with quiet joy in the sight and presence of
their enemies. But, as just said, the tranquil
joy which is theirs comes not from the
fact that danger has been all removed, nor
from the fact that they have become hardened
and used to its presence. They know
it is always near; and they are conscious, as
far as animals can be, of their own utter
helplessness, if left to themselves, to survive
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page140">[pg 140]</span><a name="Pg140" id="Pg140" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
an attack of their powerful enemies. But
they do not fear, they are not disturbed or
anxious, solely for the reason that they feel
their shepherd is present, and they know he
will guard and protect them. Hence the
Psalmist is speaking for the sheep when he
says to the shepherd with a tone of confident
joy, <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou spreadest before me a table
in the presence of mine enemies.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The spiritual meaning of this, like the
other verses of the Shepherd Psalm, is peculiarly
descriptive of our Lord, the Good
Shepherd of human souls. He, in a manner
altogether divine, precedes His elect,
and prepares them the way of salvation.
He does not deliver them from enemies and
dangers, which would be unnatural in the
present state, but He makes use of evils, as
said before, to increase the perfection of
His chosen souls. Gradually, step by step,
from a natural He leads them to a higher
state—from diffidence to trust, from fear to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page141">[pg 141]</span><a name="Pg141" id="Pg141" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
love, from sorrow and anguish to peace and
joy.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The change in the soul is rarely at once
and immediate; it does not come of a sudden.
At first it is difficult and repugnant
to nature to find joy in sorrow and pleasure
in pain, to see gladness in tears and rest in
disturbance, to find peace in the midst of
our enemies; but God, in His omnipotent
goodness, so disposes and provides for the
souls of His elect that sooner or later they
penetrate to the meaning of things, and find
there their hidden treasure. When the fabric
of life itself has crumbled to its native
dust, when friends have gone and charms
departed, when the very earth we tread
seems trembling beneath our feet, and every
dream of earthly bliss is fled, when enemies
sit where loved ones sat, and the heart has
all but ceased to beat, then is the acceptable
time and propitious moment, for the devout
and faithful soul, that has washed its garments
in the blood of the Lamb, to look up
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page142">[pg 142]</span><a name="Pg142" id="Pg142" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to Heaven with expectant joy. The thrilling
vision of eternal love so much desired,
so long perhaps delayed, is then, indeed,
about to dawn.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The sweetness of God and the peace of
His spirit are not to be found in the market
place, nor in the noise and clamor of the
busy street. It is not at the banquets of
earthly kings that we taste of the joys of the
Saviour's feast. It is not amid honors and
riches and the pleasures of sense that the
calm dews of Heaven refresh the soul. We
were made for a higher friendship, for a
more intimate union, for a sweeter companionship
than any that earth can provide.
And it is only when the door has been shut
to the outer world, when the vanities of time
have ceased to be sought, that the soul is
ready for the wedding garment, and able to
prepare for the marriage feast. It is in the
inner sanctuary and alone, divested of fleshy
trammels and freed from the bondage of
earthly attachments, that the soul is able to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page143">[pg 143]</span><a name="Pg143" id="Pg143" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
meet its God and hold intimate converse
with Him.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There are few, comparatively, out of the
multitude of souls that are called to the
feast which is spread for them, that ever sit
down at the Master's table. Many are invited,
and the servant is sent out at the hour
of supper to say to them that were called,
that all things are ready, and that they
should come; but they tarry, they are not
ready, they begin to make excuses and wish
to be held excused. Some are entangled in
perishable riches and cannot leave their
possessions; others are preoccupied with
worldly affairs and must not neglect their
business; still others are pursuing the pleasures
of earth, and have no time for the
things of Heaven. But the feast is not for
these, after all. The Master invites them,
He calls them, He sends His ministers in
search of them, He reproves and chides
them, He thunders against them to make
them hear and obey; but they will not come,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page144">[pg 144]</span><a name="Pg144" id="Pg144" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
they shall never taste of His banquet. He
has not spread a table for the proud, the
haughty, the arrogant; He cannot meet in
loving communion the worldly, the sensuous,
the lovers of ease and hurtful pleasures.
Such as these are not prepared to
meet Him; they would be out of place and
ill at ease in His company, they do not like
His society.<a id="noteref_60" name="noteref_60" href="#note_60"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">60</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To be able to come to the Master and to
sit at His feast there is need of preparation.
The garments of the world must be changed
for the garments of Heaven, the ways of
men must be made to yield to the ways of
God. For what is wisdom with men is
foolishness with God,<a id="noteref_61" name="noteref_61" href="#note_61"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">61</span></span></a> the weak things of
earth are the strong things of Heaven, the
outcast of the world are the chosen of the
Father Almighty. And hence our Saviour
under the figure of the master in the parable
who prepared a great supper, says of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page145">[pg 145]</span><a name="Pg145" id="Pg145" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
all those who will not hear Him, who neglect
His divine inspirations and despise the
call of His ministers, that they shall never
taste of His feast. But who, then, shall sit
down at His table? for whom has He prepared
the banquet? He tells us Himself,
that those who shall partake of His supper
are the lowly, the humble, the poor, the
lame, and the blind; the despised of men
and the outcast of the people; those who
have known sorrow and suffering and penance,
who have found the way of the cross
and embraced it; who, for the kingdom of
Heaven and the love of Christ crucified,
have given up father, and mother, and wife,
and children, and brethren and sisters; yea,
and their own life also, that they might inherit
everlasting crowns that fade not
away.<a id="noteref_62" name="noteref_62" href="#note_62"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">62</span></span></a>

St. Paul was one of these masterful spirits,
who surrendered all that he had, all that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page146">[pg 146]</span><a name="Pg146" id="Pg146" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
he prized most dearly for love of Christ
and His service. <span class="tei tei-q">“The things that were
gain to me,”</span> he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“the same have I
counted loss for Christ. Furthermore, I
count all things to be but loss for the excellent
knowledge of Jesus Christ my Lord, for
whom I have suffered the loss of all things,
and count them but as waste, that I may
gain Christ.”</span><a id="noteref_63" name="noteref_63" href="#note_63"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">63</span></span></a> What a struggle, too, was
that which St. Augustine describes, speaking
of his own conversion! The parting
with those sinful delights which had hitherto
held him in chains was like the forfeiture
of all he possessed, and it seemed to
him that life thereafter would not be worth
living; yet he generously and vigorously
gave them up that Christ might become his
possession. He has also described for us
the change. <span class="tei tei-q">“How sweet,”</span> he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“did it
at once become to me to want the sweetness
of those trifles, which to lose had been my

Thou true and highest sweetness! Thou
didst cast them forth, and in their stead
didst enter in Thyself, sweeter than all
pleasure!”</span><a id="noteref_64" name="noteref_64" href="#note_64"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">64</span></span></a>

It is such as these, heroic souls, who for
the sake of God and His kingdom, have
made the world their enemy, that compose
the company of the elect. And for these
alone it is that the Shepherd of souls has
spread a table of rest and peace, even in this
life, of which they partake in the sight of
their enemies, in the presence of those who
think evil of them, who despise and deride
them, in the sight of the world which hates
them. These holy souls, the elect of God,
whom the Father has chosen for Himself,

which crosses are intended to teach. They
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page148">[pg 148]</span><a name="Pg148" id="Pg148" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
have learned, by exclusion and retirement
from worldly festivities and pernicious delights,
to draw near to God, out of love for
His beauty and mercy, or if only to ease
their breaking hearts and dispel the loneliness

It is confidence, therefore, in their Saviour
and God that gives peace and tranquillity
to the souls of the just. To know Him,
to love Him, to trust Him, to dwell in His
presence and to please Him, throughout all
the vicissitudes and evils of life, are the objects
of their constant actions and the highest
aspirations of their fervid souls. Confident
of the favor and protection of God,
and rooted in His love, they despise all pain
and the threats of men; and in the midst of
the battle of life they rejoice in a peace of
mind and soul of which the worldling cannot
dream. The pasture in which they feed,
the banquet of which they partake are nothing
else than the love and friendship of God
which nourishes and refreshes their spirits
when to every mortal eye they seem destitute,
abandoned and alone. And this peace
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page150">[pg 150]</span><a name="Pg150" id="Pg150" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of God, which surpasseth all understanding,<a id="noteref_68" name="noteref_68" href="#note_68"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">68</span></span></a>
develops in souls truly spiritual a
habit of mind and a character of life that
even here below partake of the stability and
calm sense of victory which, in their perfection,
belong only to the state of the blessed

In these words the Psalmist alludes to one
of the most touching offices performed by
the good shepherd towards his sheep. The
day is drawing to a close, the golden orb of
light has sunk to rest, and the shadows are
creeping up the hills. The hush of night
is falling round, and the shepherd must
gather his flock into the fold. The labors,
the journeys, the trials, the wanderings of
the day are over, and now comes the time
for rest. It is a scene full of peace, and the
sheep greet its approach with feelings of
restful anticipation. Many of them are
foot-sore and lame; many have received
bruises and scratches during the journeyings
of the day; some have gaping and
bleeding wounds from the attacks of wild
beasts; while others are simply tired out
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page153">[pg 153]</span><a name="Pg153" id="Pg153" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and exhausted from the long walks and
steep climbing of hills. The shepherd
knows all this, and before leading them into
rest he takes care to see that the wounds of
all are dressed and soothed, so that nothing
shall disturb the sweet repose of their sleep.
For this purpose he stands at the door of
the fold as the sheep pass in. He has olive
oil and cedar-tar to use as healing ointments
for their wounds, and he has cool, refreshing
water for those that are worn and weary.
Lovingly and tenderly he regards each
member, as one by one they enter into rest;
and they that are wounded or over-weary
he holds back with his rod, till their scars
and sores are duly cared for and made
ready for the night's repose.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
How closely these offices performed for
the sheep by the shepherd resemble the care
of our Father and Saviour providing at the
end for the souls that He loves! He has
been with them all through life, leading,
guiding, guarding, shepherding them at all
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page154">[pg 154]</span><a name="Pg154" id="Pg154" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
times, going before them with the blessings
of goodness. And when at length the end
approaches, they feel the need of His loving-kindness
perhaps more than ever before.
Like the shepherd's flock, their needs are
many and various. Some souls there are
who, through the special grace of God, are
able to pass their lives in innocence and
holiness, living in the world, yet not of it,
dwelling in the midst of men and in the
sight of their wickedness and sin, yet undefiled
withal, beautiful witnesses of the
power and love of Him that strengthens
and preserves them.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But the majority are not thus favored.
Notwithstanding all their graces, they have
been subject to falls—perhaps to many
grievous falls; they have suffered many
wounds and bruises, they have had many
tears to shed. Multitudes there are, in fact,
who come down to the verge of life, to the
very gate of death, sin-stained, racked and
wounded, their life blood ebbing out
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page155">[pg 155]</span><a name="Pg155" id="Pg155" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
through sores and wounds which they themselves
have made by wilful open friendship
with sin and vice, the deadly foes of their
souls. We have many varying examples of
these straying souls. There is the type of
Mary Magdalen, of St. Peter, of St. Paul,
of St. Augustine, who passed a portion,
brief or prolonged, of their mortal days far
from the Father's home, feeding on the
husks of swine; but who, while yet in the
vigor of life, felt the touch of the merciful
hand and heard the sound of the loving
voice, leading them, calling them back to
God, back to the <span class="tei tei-q">“beauty ever ancient and
ever new.”</span> Such souls as these, it is true,
constitute one class of erring, but repenting
sinners; but there is another class whose
plight is far more pitiable. They are those
long-delayed, but finally repentant sinners,
men and women who have lived their lives
away from the Church and its sacraments,
who have grown old and gray in the sins of
their youth, and now, at the last, when death
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page156">[pg 156]</span><a name="Pg156" id="Pg156" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
is coming, are moved, by a special grace
from Heaven, to weep for their sins and
wasted years before they enter their eternal
abode.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For each and all of these how important
it is that the Shepherd should stand at the
door of the fold and bind up their wounds
with His tender grace before they pass
through the portals of death! Scarred and
wayward children, victims of evil circumstances,
creatures of vanity and of folly,
they realize at the end how impotent they
are, how helpless in the presence of the
coldness of death to redeem or make sure
the years that are fled, unless He draw near
and assist them who has sustained them in
life, and who is at once the author and the
master of both life and death!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But for all, without exception, the need
of the Shepherd is imperative at the end.
The victory, the happy issue of life's struggle,
<span class="tei tei-q">“is not of him that willeth, nor of him
that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.”</span><a id="noteref_71" name="noteref_71" href="#note_71"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">71</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page157">[pg 157]</span><a name="Pg157" id="Pg157" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
All may run, all may strive, indeed,
for the prize of eternal life, but none can be
sure, short of the mercy of God, that he will
be saved; none can merit this crowning
glory of life. Whether young or old,
whether favored or neglected, whether innocent
or guilty, whether the life has been
dowered with special blessings and never
known the stain of grievous sin, or whether
it has been eked out amidst deepest misery
and defiled with hateful crimes, the same
uncertainty for all remains as to the manner
in which the end shall come. Men may
reason and conjecture, from what they see
and know, that this one or that is in God's
favor, and shall so persevere to the end; that
the members of a certain family, or class,
or station in life, are sure to be saved, and
shall never fall short; but that those of another
class or condition shall, on the contrary,
die as they have lived, in the filth of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page158">[pg 158]</span><a name="Pg158" id="Pg158" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
their sins, to be forever in torment. But
these are the reasonings of men, which are
of no avail in the sight of God. It is only
the Father in Heaven who knows the elect.
He alone is able to tell who shall remain to
be crowned, and who is to be condemned.
Perseverance is a gratuitous gift of God, we
cannot merit it. All our good actions and
holy deeds, which are performed in the state
of grace and out of a motive of charity, do,
it is true, merit a reward in Heaven, they
tend to increase our blessedness hereafter;
but just as it is not in our power to merit
the first grace, by which we are raised from
a state of sin, so are we utterly unable to do
anything which shall secure for a certainty
the final grace, by which alone we can be
saved. Wherefore the Preacher said: <span class="tei tei-q">“All
these things have I considered in my heart,
that I might carefully understand them:
there are just men and wise men, and their
works are in the hand of God; and yet man
knoweth not whether he be worthy of love
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page159">[pg 159]</span><a name="Pg159" id="Pg159" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
or hatred. But all things are kept uncertain
for the time to come, because all things
equally happen to the just and to the wicked,
to the good and to the evil, to the clean and
to the unclean, to him that offereth victims,
and to him that despiseth sacrifices. As the
good is, so also is the sinner; as the perjured,
so he also that sweareth truth.”</span><a id="noteref_72" name="noteref_72" href="#note_72"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">72</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This uncertainty as to the end of life, and
of the gift of final perseverance, all holy
souls have felt. To die in the friendship
of God, and thence to enjoy His presence
forever, is a gift of so transcendent a nature,
so far above our natural powers and utmost
deserts that no creature, which can at all
conceive it, would dare claim it as a right.
It was this conviction that made the saints
tremble to think of it. This it was that
prompted St. Paul to admonish the Philippians
to work out their salvation with fear
and trembling,<a id="noteref_73" name="noteref_73" href="#note_73"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">73</span></span></a> and that also evoked from
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page160">[pg 160]</span><a name="Pg160" id="Pg160" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the same Apostle those candid words concerning
himself: <span class="tei tei-q">“I chastise my body, and
bring it into subjection; lest, perhaps, when
I have preached to others, I myself should
become a castaway.”</span><a id="noteref_74" name="noteref_74" href="#note_74"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">74</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And have we not sometimes witnessed instances
which, so far as man can judge, give
ground for this fear as to perseverance, and
emphasize the great truth that to die in
God's favor is, indeed, a singular and a
gratuitous gift? How many have we not
known who started well, but terminated ill!
How many are innocent and holy in youth
and give every promise of splendid manhood,
but fade and drop, like poisoned
flowers, ere the age of maturity has dawned!
How many are able to pass through the
most critical period of their lives, unshaken
and undefiled, full of faith, hope, love,
purity; but who, when the age of security
is thought to have come, lose the grip which
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page161">[pg 161]</span><a name="Pg161" id="Pg161" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
seemed so firm, turn to evil, yield to vicious
habits, and die reprobates of God! Look
at King Solomon! Who was ever more
promising than he in his youth? Who ever
gave fairer prospects of continued holiness
and of a beautiful end? He was so lovely,
so amiable, so favored of God in the morning
of life; graced with such high perfections,
not knowing evil, a stranger to vice,
a lover of sanctity, of wisdom, and of grace.
It would seem that he could never fall—he
who was the object of such unwonted favors,
who dwelt so supremely in the smile of
Heaven. But lo, and behold the end of him
who had received so many graces, who chose
wisdom as his handmaid that he might be
guided aright! Behold that youthful figure,
so full of promise and goodly hope,
praying to God that he might never deviate
from the ways of grace; and then see the
gray-haired apostate tottering to the grave,
borne down by the weight of his sins and of
his years! And how many more there have
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page162">[pg 162]</span><a name="Pg162" id="Pg162" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
been, like King Saul, like Renan and Voltaire,
and numerous others that we ourselves
perhaps have known, who were great and
good in youth, and for a term of years, but
whose end was a miserable failure!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Our perseverance, then, or the favor to die
in the state of grace, is not of ourselves, not
the reward of our efforts, or of our good
works, <span class="tei tei-q">“but of God that sheweth mercy.”</span>
We must do all in our power to merit eternal
life; we must press on to the mark, waging
ceaseless battle in behalf of God and of
our souls, even to the last moment; but for
the happy end of it all we must perforce
rely on the tender mercy of God. This is
why our Lord, before He departed from
earth, prayed to His heavenly Father for
His disciples: <span class="tei tei-q">“Holy Father, keep them in
Thy name whom Thou hast given me; ...
I pray not that thou shouldst take them out
of the world; but that thou shouldst keep
them from evil.”</span><a id="noteref_75" name="noteref_75" href="#note_75"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">75</span></span></a> This same truth the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page163">[pg 163]</span><a name="Pg163" id="Pg163" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Psalmist also had in mind when he prayed:
<span class="tei tei-q">“Perfect thou my goings in thy paths, that
my footsteps be not moved.”</span><a id="noteref_76" name="noteref_76" href="#note_76"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">76</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is this appalling uncertainty about the
end and outcome of life, together with our
own inability to make them secure, that
makes death so terrible to the minds and
thoughts of multitudes, even of Christians
and well-living persons. They fear to fall
into the hands of the living God. For them
the present life may be not so attractive; on
the contrary, it is likely replete with pain
and toil; but somehow they wish to linger
here, preferring that which is certain, although
so miserable, to that which is doubtful,
perhaps awful and irreparable. So
long as they continue in this present world
there is chance for change, there is hope of
improvement. But when death intervenes,
and the soul is removed to the other life, all
hopes of change are swept away, and the lot
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page164">[pg 164]</span><a name="Pg164" id="Pg164" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the soul is fixed for eternity. There is,
of course, a fear of death which is altogether
natural. Many dread death who pretend
not to believe in a future life, or even in the
existence of God. And many there are
whose lives are holy, and who have not
whereof they ought to fear, but for whom,
nevertheless, the very thought of death is
fraught with all manner of terrors. As
some are naturally afraid in the absence of
light, and tremble with fear at being alone
in a dark and lonely dwelling, or spot, or
place, so there are many who, without assignable
reason, other than a native tendency,
are appalled at the thought of death.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But when all due allowances have been
made for the uncertainty of final perseverance,
and for the anxiety arising from natural
temperament, it seems not too much to
say that, for the most part, the fear and
dread of death which haunts so many Christians
can be reduced to two causes: a defect
of faith or a love of the world. It is one
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page165">[pg 165]</span><a name="Pg165" id="Pg165" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of these causes, or both of them together,
which alone can explain, in the majority
of cases, why such numbers of Christians
and Catholics are unwilling to surrender
the present life, and are disturbed at the
very thought of dying. Either they do not
realize by faith the surpassing glories of the
life beyond—doubting its reality, questioning
its nature, misunderstanding the goodness
and mercy of God; or else they are so
attached to the present existence that all
serious thought and desire for a better life
are excluded from their minds and hearts.
Fenelon says that the condition of our spiritual
life is indicated by the answers we give
to the following questions: <span class="tei tei-q">“Do I love to
think of God? Am I willing to suffer for
God? Does my desire to be with Him destroy
my fear of death?”</span> We do not fear to
meet or to be with one whom we really love,
for <span class="tei tei-q">“love casteth out fear.”</span> There is no
dread at the coming of the parent or friend
whom we truly love, unless, perchance, we
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page166">[pg 166]</span><a name="Pg166" id="Pg166" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
have offended him, and lack full faith that
we have been forgiven and reinstated in his
favor and friendship.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
So it is with God. If we are unwilling
to meet Him, or filled with fear at the approach
of His coming, it seems of a certainty
that our faith is at fault. Why should
we not wish to meet Him who has made
us, who loves us, who has washed away our
sins with His own blood, who alone can
comfort our trembling souls and fill us with
every good? Perhaps we have sinned and
betrayed our Maker many times and grievously
in our lives, and the voices of those
sins are haunting us, and bidding us beware
of the hour of death and of the judgment
that follows. Perhaps there is a lurking
suspicion that we have not been forgiven, a
temptation that we are not sincere, a feeling
that our sins are too grave to be pardoned, a
conviction that we do not belong to the
company of the elect. We may have notions,
moreover, altogether severe, of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page167">[pg 167]</span><a name="Pg167" id="Pg167" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
nature of God and of His justice; we feel
His immensity and sanctity, we have heard
so much of His ineffable beauty, that,
weighed down with a sense of our nothingness,
of our poverty and misery and sinfulness,
we cannot but shudder at the thought
of appearing in His presence. These and
similar terrors may take hold of us and fill
us with a dread of death; but is it not clear
that, whatever their cause, these fears are
born of a lack of faith? We do not trust,
as we ought, the Shepherd that loves us, we
are not convinced of His mercy and kindness,
if we do not believe with child-like
confidence that He stands ready ever to forgive
and bless the least of His children that
humbly and sincerely seek Him, asking for
the help they need. The severity of God
toward sinners endures only so long as they
refuse to acknowledge their guilt. His
harshness with them, like that of Joseph
with his brethren, is but love in disguise;
and as soon as they are brought to own their
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page168">[pg 168]</span><a name="Pg168" id="Pg168" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
guilt, that which before was the anger of
God is swiftly turned into His love and
mercy. Christ did not come to destroy, but
to save. He will not crush the broken reed,
nor extinguish the smoking flax.<a id="noteref_77" name="noteref_77" href="#note_77"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">77</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“As a
father hath compassion on his children, so
hath the Lord compassion on them that fear
him; for he knoweth our frame, he remembereth
that we are dust.”</span><a id="noteref_78" name="noteref_78" href="#note_78"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">78</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But there is also the love of the world,
which enslaves so many. So numerous and
so bewitching are the attractions of the present
life that they are loath to leave them.
It is a beautiful world, this universe of ours,
so deep, so wide, so vast! It is filled with
pleasures and allurements and graced with
myriad charms; and he, indeed, seems cold
of heart who can easily turn from its enchanting
beauties, and close his ear to its
manifold voices. Ponder for a moment the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page169">[pg 169]</span><a name="Pg169" id="Pg169" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
richness of nature, its similarity and variety,
its sameness and its diversity; consider the
abundance of the harvest—the glowing
fruits, the green and golden crops, the sweet-scented
flowers and gift-bearing grasses; see
the stars above and the waters beneath—all
the wonders of earth and sky; and then
when you have ranged over fields and waves
and mountains, when you have climbed up
the steeps of the sky and gazed on the marvels
of the heavens, descend again to earth
and consider the human form—the chiefest
work of the Almighty hand, and the crown
of the natural world. What beauties are
here concealed! What a mingling of material
and spiritual, of human and almost
divine! What words can express, what lines
portray the beauty of the human countenance?
Who can describe or adequately
define the loveliness that streams from human
eyes, or echoes from the human voice?
And yet these are but the outer fringes and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page170">[pg 170]</span><a name="Pg170" id="Pg170" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
dimmest glimpses of the beauties of the soul
that dwells within.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
How painful, then, it is for the worldly
to forsake the beauties and pleasures of this
present life. Bound down to their beds of
clay by the things of sense, they are grieved
to part with a life so full of diverse attractions.
How can they think undismayed of
closing forever their eyes and ears to these
charms of color and sound! It is such a
difficult thing, and so hard to nature, to
abandon these scenes of enticing pleasure, to
bid farewell to those that are dear and be
hurried away alone and forlorn to the chill
and gloom of the grave.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
So reason the children of the world; but
are not their reasonings and feelings a proof
of their little faith, and of their poor conceptions
of spiritual and eternal interests?
They do not want to leave the world, because
they love it; and they love the world,
because their faith is too weak to raise them
to a vision of higher things. The plain on
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page171">[pg 171]</span><a name="Pg171" id="Pg171" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
which they stand is too low clearly to see
the things of Heaven. How poor and
trifling at best is the earth and all it contains
to Him who beholds with a vivid faith the
world above that is to come! How gladly
does he lay down his life and give up the
struggle with ceaseless battles, who sees by
faith, just beyond the portals of death, the
great home of the blessed, spread out like
a city on the mountains, bathed in light inaccessible,
full of joy and unending gladness,
where <span class="tei tei-q">“death shall be no more, nor
mourning, nor crying, nor sorrow shall be
any more.”</span><a id="noteref_79" name="noteref_79" href="#note_79"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">79</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The man of faith, therefore, is in no wise
straightened or disturbed by the approach
of death. He has learned to know and to
trust the good Master whom he serves. Like
the Apostle, he is only concerned that Christ
should be glorified in him at all times and in
all things, <span class="tei tei-q">“whether it be by life or by
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page172">[pg 172]</span><a name="Pg172" id="Pg172" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
death;”</span> for to him also, <span class="tei tei-q">“to live is Christ,
and to die is gain.”</span><a id="noteref_80" name="noteref_80" href="#note_80"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">80</span></span></a> He lives in the world,
but is not of it; he treads the ways of earth,
but he really belongs to the kingdom above.
Hence his cup of interior peace is ever running
over. Though surrounded by many
evils, he does not faint; though tempted exceedingly,
he does not yield; but is joyous
and peaceful withal; because at all times
and in all things he feels himself to be the
faithful servant of God, <span class="tei tei-q">“in much patience,
in tribulation, in necessities, in distresses, in
strifes, in prisons, in seditions, in labors, in
watchings, in fastings, in chastity, in knowledge,
in long-suffering, in sweetness, in the
Holy Ghost, in charity unfeigned; ...
as dying, and yet living; as chastised, and
not killed; as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing;
as needy, yet enriching many; as having
nothing, yet possessing all things.”</span><a id="noteref_81" name="noteref_81" href="#note_81"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">81</span></span></a>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page173">[pg 173]</span><a name="Pg173" id="Pg173" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Precious in the sight of God is the death
of His Saints.”</span> As they have lived for
Christ, they gladly welcome the summons
that calls them home to rest. Calmly and
fearlessly they go down to death; joyously
and with feelings of exultation they hail the
coming of Him on whom their thoughts
have rested throughout life, of Him whom
they have ever seen by faith, whom they
have loved, whom they have trusted, whom
they have chosen for their own. Confident
of the power and goodness of their faithful
Shepherd, pain daunts them not, the enemy
frets them not. The last hour for them is
not one of darkness, but of light; it is not a
time for lamentations, but for joyous and
gladsome strains. The end may be sudden,
or it may be gradual in its approach; it may
come early, or late in life; it may be at home
or abroad; it may be in the winter, or it
may be in summer; on the sea or on the
land; but to the just and spiritual it can
never be a surprise, it can never be lonely,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page174">[pg 174]</span><a name="Pg174" id="Pg174" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
never sad. It is the time for which they
have always longed—a time of liberation,
of emancipation from the trammels of earth
and flesh, the end of continuous dying and
the beginning of lasting life. What a supreme
moment, what a joyous event is death
for a just and holy soul! What sweet emotions
must thrill the spirit, as the Saviour
stoops over the bed of death to wipe away
forever the last of earthly tears! Mary is
there to hush the voice of reproach and to
whisper words of peace; Jesus has come to
claim the soul and take it to Himself, and
flights of angels are waiting to sing it to its
rest.

Me All the Days of My Life;
and I Shall Dwell in the House of
the Lord Unto Length of Days.</span></h1>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If the tender lambs and timid sheep of the
shepherd's flock could speak the sentiments
of their innocent hearts, each one would
certainly voice the words which here the
Psalmist has uttered for them all. Throughout
the live-long day, throughout all the
days of their lives, they experience the shepherd's
goodness, they are the objects of his
constant mercy. He has been caring for
them since their birth; he has led them out
each morning, since first they were able to
walk; he has provided them with food, and
led them to water; and he has ever been
present to shield them from harm, and to
protect them from their enemies. After
such repeated experiences and trials of his
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page176">[pg 176]</span><a name="Pg176" id="Pg176" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
loving-kindness, they have grown accustomed
to his faithfulness and are filled with
love of his goodness and mercy. And while
they have not the power of speech, and cannot
by words express their feelings, they do
by the louder voice of action—by their quiet
trust in his care, by their habitual mildness
and gentleness and quick response to his
every word, by the absence of solicitude and
fear in view of his presence—by these and
all the other actions that speak their simple
hearts they show their love for their shepherd.
Though often wounded and bleeding
and exhausted from the roughness and
length of their journeys, they have no distrust
about the future, no fear for the morrow.
In the midst of distress the shepherd,
they know, will provide. The Psalmist,
therefore, in the closing words of the shepherd
song, gives utterance to the feelings of
the sheep when he sings: <span class="tei tei-q">“Surely goodness
and mercy shall follow me all the days of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page177">[pg 177]</span><a name="Pg177" id="Pg177" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
my life, and I shall dwell in the house of
the Lord unto length of days.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But here, as in the opening verse of the
Shepherd Psalm, the words of the sacred
Singer, although truly expressive of the
sentiments of the sheep, are more directly
the expression of his own inner feelings,
and of the feelings of all faithful souls towards
the Lord who rules and guides them.
All those whose lives have been really and
sincerely led by faith, have, like the shepherd's
flock, grown trustfully accustomed,
in the course of years, to the goodness and
mercy, to the faithfulness and love of the
hand that provides for them. As they look
into their lives, and retrace the steps they
have taken, they cannot fail to see how God
has been always with them, patiently enduring
their faults, mercifully binding
up their wounds and hurts, and lovingly
leading, drawing them to Himself.
They can see their advancement, slow perhaps
as it has been; and they know it is
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page178">[pg 178]</span><a name="Pg178" id="Pg178" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
God who has given the increase. Looking
now at their lives through the perspective
of the years that are gone, how many problems
they are able to solve! for how many
apparent mysteries they have found an explanation!
All those crosses and trials, all
those struggles and battles with the enemy,
all those attacks from within and assaults
from without, all, in fact, that they have
ever endured, their sins alone excepted, they
now can trace, through the light of faith,
back to the hand of their Father in Heaven.
Not everything, forsooth, has yet been explained,
but enough, indeed, is sufficiently
clear to remove every doubt from the faithful
soul as to the goodness and Providence
of God. And hence she exclaims with the
Psalmist, out of the abundance of her faith
and confidence, <span class="tei tei-q">“Surely goodness and mercy
shall follow me all the days of my life; and
I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is doubtless a lack of implicit trust in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page179">[pg 179]</span><a name="Pg179" id="Pg179" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
God and divine Providence which, more
than anything else, accounts for the unhappiness
and spiritual barrenness of so many
Christian and religious lives. Poor and
scanty is the fruit they yield, simply because
they have no depth of soil, they are not
deeply and firmly rooted in faith and confidence
in God. Like reeds shaken by the
wind, like houses built on the sand, they
tremble and shake with every blast, they
are all but overturned by every tempest that
rises.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Nor is it wonderful that this should be so.
The higher gifts of the spirit come from
God, and hence the good fruit which the
spirit yields is also traceable back to Him.
<span class="tei tei-q">“We do not gather grapes from thorns nor
figs from thistles; and as a good tree cannot
bring forth evil fruit, so neither can an
evil tree bring forth good fruit.”</span><a id="noteref_82" name="noteref_82" href="#note_82"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">82</span></span></a> And
just because the abundance of the harvest
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page180">[pg 180]</span><a name="Pg180" id="Pg180" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the spiritual life is dependent upon God
as its giver, is it strange that any distrust of
Him and His Providence should be a great
hindrance to the soul's advancement, and
to the bestowal of the constant help it needs?
Can God be pleased with those who do not
confide in Him, and who do not trust Him?
Our Lord's own chiding words to His disciples
are a proof of His displeasure at any
distrust in His power and goodness. How
often did He rebuke them for their want of
confidence in Him! How often did He accuse
them reproachfully of their <span class="tei tei-q">“little
faith,”</span><a id="noteref_83" name="noteref_83" href="#note_83"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">83</span></span></a> of being <span class="tei tei-q">“slow of
heart,”</span><a id="noteref_84" name="noteref_84" href="#note_84"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">84</span></span></a> of being
an <span class="tei tei-q">“unbelieving and perverse generation!”</span><a id="noteref_85" name="noteref_85" href="#note_85"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">85</span></span></a>
He was constantly pointing to their lack of
faith, reminding them that it was the source
of their weakness, the cause of their ignorance
in things spiritual, the reason of their
powerlessness in the face of difficulties and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page181">[pg 181]</span><a name="Pg181" id="Pg181" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
against the enemies of their souls. It is
clear that Almighty God, being a generous
and loving Father, must be offended at those
of His children who do not trust Him; and
their want of faith in Him is consequently
the reason for His denying to them the help
which is the life of their souls, and without
which they are powerless to be useful servants
in His vineyard.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And this failure to confide in the goodness
of God betrays itself in other ways. Besides
sealing up the fountains of special
graces and closing the door on divine generosity,
besides a general unfruitfulness in
the spiritual life, and the lack of all greater
works for God and for souls, which are its
immediate consequences, it also penetrates
into the interior sanctuary of the spirit, and
weakens at their source the springs of spiritual
action. The results are manifest. Not
only is there no yielding of fruit, but growth
is likewise wanting. And if, under fairer
conditions, there has ever been any progress,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page182">[pg 182]</span><a name="Pg182" id="Pg182" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
it is soon perceived to wither and wane in a
soul devoid of living faith. All the exercises
and practices of the Christian life participate
in the baneful effects. Prayer and
the use of the sacraments are either seriously
neglected or gradually given up, and
the blighting influences of irreligion rapidly
spread and overrun all the departments of
life. The view one takes of God, the faith
or lack of faith and trust one has in Providence,
have their effect on the character and
give a direction to all one's ways of thinking,
feeling, acting, in regard to the world
we live in, in regard to mankind in general,
in regard to the causes, purposes, and destinies
of all things.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Our conceptions of Providence are vital,
therefore. They really determine what our
life is to be, and they are an index to the
life that is finished. It is impossible that
we should be quite the same whether we
try to eliminate God from our lives, or allow
His blessed influence to cheer and lead
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page183">[pg 183]</span><a name="Pg183" id="Pg183" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
us on; whether we look upon Him as a cold
Master, waiting to exact and to punish, or
as a kind Father and Shepherd, seeking to
spare and to save; whether we regard Him
as hid far in the heavens, caring naught for
the creatures and the world He has made,
or whether we conceive Him as intimately
bound up with all the works of His hands,
although distinct from them, as guiding and
regulating everything, as tenderly loving
and providing for all the needs of our souls.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Another most harmful result of deficient
faith and confidence in God is that it leads
us to trust in creatures. It causes us to reverse
the proper order of things. We are
dependent beings, and we instinctively feel
our deficiencies and the need of some one,
or something on which to lean, at times,
and to which we can look for assistance.
We may not be entirely and always conscious
of this tendency in us, we may be too
proud or too blind to admit it, or we may
wish we could overcome it and rid our lives
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page184">[pg 184]</span><a name="Pg184" id="Pg184" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of so constant a need; but whether we see it
and acknowledge it or not, whether we encourage
it or try to repress it, the need is
always there, deeply engraved in our nature
as creatures, and we cannot but seek to satisfy
it. There is none of us, frail beings
that we are, who is entirely sufficient unto
himself. Sometimes, of course, the voice
of our needs is silent, and we feel that we
shall never want; <span class="tei tei-q">“I said in my abundance,”</span>
observes the Psalmist, <span class="tei tei-q">“I shall not be moved
forever;”</span><a id="noteref_86" name="noteref_86" href="#note_86"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">86</span></span></a> but when the tide begins to ebb
and prosperity subsides, how soon do we remember
that we are dust! How frequently
in times of trouble, in times of illness and
poverty and suffering, when face to face
with our foes, or when death steps in and
slaughters, are we made aware of our insufficiency,
and of our utter helplessness to live
our lives alone and meet single-handed the
burdens and misfortunes of earth! It takes
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page185">[pg 185]</span><a name="Pg185" id="Pg185" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
but a little frost to nip the root of all our
greatness, and then when our high-blown
pride breaks under us we quickly realize
how fragile and insecure are the personal
foundations of our lives. Naturally and
reasonably, therefore, did the pagan philosophers
conclude that friendship and friends
were necessary to man.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Profoundly aware of this fundamental
need of help and support which is a result
of our nature, we habitually stretch out our
hands to others, not only during the years
of infancy and childhood, but to a greater
or less extent throughout the whole period
of our earthly existence. At first, of course,
it is to creatures that we necessarily look—to
parents, relatives, guardians, teachers,
and later on, to friends and acquaintances.
Our needs in the beginning and in early
years, though many and imperative, are
comparatively simple; they can be satisfied
by those around us. But as we advance to
maturity and take in more completely the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page186">[pg 186]</span><a name="Pg186" id="Pg186" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
meaning of our lives, and consider not so
much the needs of the body as the demands
of the soul, we find that the multiple requirements
of infancy and youth, which
were able to be supplied by those that were
near, have given way to the fewer, but vast
and unlimited, claims of age, which express
the wants of the spirit. It is when we appeal
to creatures for the complete and permanent
satisfaction of these latter necessities
of our being, that we seriously err, and
open the way to disappointment and sorrow.
Not that we are to have no cherished and
chosen friends, or that we should despise
the needs and gifts, the privileges and blessings
of friendship, which in truth our nature
requires; nor again that we are to regard
with skeptical, disdainful eyes the
world and human nature; but we must not
deceive ourselves by trying to find in any
created being that which it does not possess.
We must not endeavor to get from any creature
that perfect satisfaction which we need,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page187">[pg 187]</span><a name="Pg187" id="Pg187" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and which the Creator alone can give.
Neither must we seek to fill the unlimited
capacity of our souls with those gifts only,
poor and defective at best, which frail mortals
like ourselves are able to supply. It is
folly in the highest degree to expect from
anyone less than God that which only God
can afford.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The mistake, therefore, is made when
creatures of any kind are allowed to take
the place of God; when they are sought and
reposed in as an end in themselves, and as
sufficient satisfaction for the needs of the
human spirit. Unwise, indeed, is this mode
of action, and bitter are the sorrows of soul
to which it inevitably leads! One man
trusts in riches, another in glory, another in
the esteem of men; one leans upon his
friends and companions, another upon his
relatives—all forgetful of the frail and unsubstantial
nature of every earthly prop.
Frequently they never awaken to the peril
of their state until they find themselves face
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page188">[pg 188]</span><a name="Pg188" id="Pg188" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to face with their doom and the awful disillusionment.
The crash may be delayed, but
the day must come sooner or later for all of
us, who have advanced but a little beyond
maturity, when all the natural lights of life
go out, when every human prop is removed,
and we find ourselves out alone and in the
dark, so far as depends on the world and
creatures. How miserable then shall we be
if we have put our trust in men! if we have
tried to make creatures play the part in our
lives which only God can play! When we
need them most they fail us, when we fain
would find beneath their protection a shield
against the fiery darts of life, behold they
wither like the ivy of Jonas and leave us
alone in our want!<a id="noteref_87" name="noteref_87" href="#note_87"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">87</span></span></a> How vain, therefore,
and groundless is that confidence which is
put in men, and how wretched that poor
man that hangs on princes' favors! <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou
trustest in money,”</span> says St. Augustine, <span class="tei tei-q">“thou
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page189">[pg 189]</span><a name="Pg189" id="Pg189" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
holdest to vanity; thou trustest in honor, and
in some eminence of human power, thou
holdest to vanity; thou trustest in some principal
friend, thou holdest to vanity. When
thou trustest in all these things, either thou
diest and leavest them here, or in thy lifetime
they all perish, and thou failest in thy
trust.”</span><a id="noteref_88" name="noteref_88" href="#note_88"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">88</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is no despisal, then, of the needs and
helps of earthly friends and of our fellow-creatures
to say that we should not put entire
trust in them for all the wants and demands
of our being. They are good, they
were made by God, they are oftentimes able
to assist us—nay, we need them to a certain
extent; but they are utterly unable to satisfy
us completely, they cannot if they would,
simply because of the extent of our wants.
And even if creatures could give us a partial
contentment, as at times they seem to do,
we know that it cannot last, and in the midst
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page190">[pg 190]</span><a name="Pg190" id="Pg190" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of our joy and pleasure we are haunted by
the thought that some day, soon at latest, it
all must pass away. We are seeking for
rest, for peace, for happiness, and that unending;
we want something to steady our
lives and satisfy the yearnings of our souls
forever: but we must not look for these
things in the world, for the world at best is
passing away. There is no stability to human
things; the cloud and the storm swiftly
follow the sunshine; we have not here below
a lasting habitation. Today we are sitting
at the banquet of pleasure, tomorrow we are
draining the cup of sorrow; today we receive
the applause of men, tomorrow we
may be the objects of their scorn; today we
put forth the tender leaves of hope, tomorrow
there comes a killing frost that ruins all
our prospects.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Such, then, is the lot of man when considered
in his relations to creatures and to
the world. It is a lot full of uncertainty,
of instability, of vicissitude; but this should
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page191">[pg 191]</span><a name="Pg191" id="Pg191" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
not make us skeptical or cynical; it affords
no justification for pessimism. It is a condition
arising, on the one hand, from the
very nature of limited beings, and on the
other, from the vast potentialities of our
souls, which, while they are limited in giving
to others, cannot be appeased except by
the God who made them. There is a craving
in the heart of man for something which
the world cannot give. He clutches for the
things that are passing, he toils, he labors,
he struggles; he strives for money, for
power, for place, for honor, not that any of
these things are in themselves what he desires,
but only because he conceives them as
means and helps to the satisfaction, to the
stillness of mind, and peace of heart, and
rest of soul and body for which his nature
longs. Peace and happiness and contentment
of life are the objects of all our
dreams, of our persistent efforts, of our ambitions
and aims; but until we give up the
hope of finding these things in the world, in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page192">[pg 192]</span><a name="Pg192" id="Pg192" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
our fellow-mortals, in anything short of
God, we shall never know the blessedness
for which we yearn. If we would ever attain
to the state which we covet, we must
learn the lesson, even though it be through
tears and sorrow, that God alone, who made
our souls with all their vast desires, is able
to comfort us and steady our lives amid the
storms and distresses of earth.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is futile to trust in men, or <span class="tei tei-q">“in the children
of men, in whom there is no salvation.”</span><a id="noteref_89" name="noteref_89" href="#note_89"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">89</span></span></a>

unless we turn away from the world and
cease to torture our lives with its vanities,
our portion can never be other than heartaches,
secret loathing, consuming thirst.
<span class="tei tei-q">“For many friends cannot profit,”</span> says
Thomas a'Kempis, <span class="tei tei-q">“nor strong helpers assist,
nor prudent counsellors give a profitable

answer, nor the books of the learned
afford comfort, nor any precious substance
deliver, nor any place, however retired and
lovely, give shelter, unless thou thyself dost
assist, help, strengthen, console, instruct, and

Such has been the history of
the race, and such is the experience of every
individual in the race that has placed his
hope and trust in anything created.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We are confronted, therefore, on the one
side by the inherent weakness of our own
nature and the constant needs that arise
therefrom; and on the other side, we are
assured by the history of the race, if not by
our own experience, that so long as we strive
to satisfy our wants by an appeal to anything
but God we are doomed to disappointment
and sorrow. It is unfortunate that most
people must first be crushed by the world
and creatures which they serve before they
grasp the fundamental truth that creatures
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page194">[pg 194]</span><a name="Pg194" id="Pg194" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
are not their God. Comparatively few of
those who enjoy the world are ever brought
to realize the dignity and divine purpose of
their souls until the world and its allurements,
like a false pageant on a false stage,
give way beneath them, and they fall helpless
and alone. It is commonly only after
repeated awful experiences, when worn out
and exhausted by years of fruitless quest for
peace and happiness and contentment, that
men wake up to the simple fact that the
treasures which they seek are not in the
world, nor as the world giveth.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But it is one thing to turn away from
the world disappointed, disgusted and betrayed;
and it is quite another thing to turn
to God and to recognize Him as our good
Father and Shepherd, patiently waiting to
receive us, ever able and ready to satisfy our
wants. There are many people who find
the world a disappointment and a deception,
and who turn from it with loathing and
hate, but who fail ever to lift their weary
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page195">[pg 195]</span><a name="Pg195" id="Pg195" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
eyes to the proper object of their trust. Like
the Israelites of old, they succeed at length
in escaping from the hands of oppression
and tyranny, but only to wander in a desert
land throughout the length of their days.
This is the region where dwell the pessimist,
the skeptic and the cynic—miserable mortals
that have wasted on creatures the talents
they should have given to their Creator, or
that have otherwise failed in their conception
of life, and have left unmultiplied the
money of the Master.<a id="noteref_92" name="noteref_92" href="#note_92"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">92</span></span></a> There is plainly no
middle course for us, if we would not encounter
disaster; we are not negative as to
the necessities of our nature; it is not enough
for us to turn from positive harm, from the
objects that deceive and disappoint us; we
must further turn to positive good, and to
Him who alone can quiet and appease our
yearning spirits.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
One of the most evident and convincing
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page196">[pg 196]</span><a name="Pg196" id="Pg196" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
reasons, then, why we should put our trust
in God above all else is that He alone can
satisfy and give us rest. Only God is able
adequately to respond to all the needs of our
being. The simplest process of reasoning
should assure us of this, when once we perceive
the vastness of our wants and the impossibility
of their satisfaction through the
medium of created things. We know our
nature, which has come from the source and
essence of truth, cannot be false. Neither
can our unlimited capacities for knowledge,
for joy, for happiness be a deceiving
mockery. There is a way to peace
for us, and a source of supreme contentment;
there is a fountain of living waters
from which, if we drink, we shall never
thirst again. Hence our Saviour said:
<span class="tei tei-q">“Come to me all you that labour and are
burdened, and I will refresh you;”</span><a id="noteref_93" name="noteref_93" href="#note_93"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">93</span></span></a> and
again, <span class="tei tei-q">“he that shall drink of the water
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page197">[pg 197]</span><a name="Pg197" id="Pg197" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that I will give him shall not thirst forever:
but the water that I will give him shall become
in him a fountain of water, springing
up into life everlasting.”</span><a id="noteref_94" name="noteref_94" href="#note_94"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">94</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But we shall never be able to come to
God, we shall never succeed even in getting
near the secret of interior peace and contentment
until we are able to grasp more or
less comprehensively the great basic truths
of our existence: that God loves each one of
us with the love of an infinite Father, and
that His Providence is so universal and omnipotent
as to extend to all things, even to
the numbering of the hairs of our head.
We talk much about chance and fortune and
accident, we speak every day of things happening,
as if by the sheerest contingence,
without warning or previous knowledge;
and so it is with reference to ourselves, and
to all the world perhaps: but with reference
to divine Providence it is not so; there is
nothing accidental, nothing unforeseen with
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page198">[pg 198]</span><a name="Pg198" id="Pg198" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
respect to God. <span class="tei tei-q">“Without Thy counsel and
Providence, and without cause, nothing
cometh to pass in the earth,”</span><a id="noteref_95" name="noteref_95" href="#note_95"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">95</span></span></a> says the Imitation.
But what does this mean, <span class="tei tei-q">“God
provides?”</span> It means that the will of the
omnipotent Father directs and governs
everything. <span class="tei tei-q">“Providence,”</span> says St. John
Damscene, <span class="tei tei-q">“is the will of God, by which
all things are fitly and harmoniously governed,”</span><a id="noteref_96" name="noteref_96" href="#note_96"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">96</span></span></a>
and such is its power that nothing
can elude or deceive it, neither can it be hindered
or baffled in any way. <span class="tei tei-q">“For God will
not except any man's person, neither will
He stand in awe of any man's greatness; for
He made the little and the great, and He
hath equally care of all.”</span><a id="noteref_97" name="noteref_97" href="#note_97"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">97</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And just as divine Providence disposes
and governs all the events of life, directing
each to its proper end, so the divine Will is
the cause of everything that exists. Just as
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page199">[pg 199]</span><a name="Pg199" id="Pg199" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
it is impossible that anything should escape
God's knowledge and directing hand, so is
it impossible that anything should exist or
come into being without the direct intervention
or permission of His will. There
is nothing in the world which God has not
made, and nothing takes place which is not
according to His good-pleasure, except the
malice and guilt of sin. Even all the other
evils of life, such as sickness, suffering, disease,
poverty, cold, hunger, thirst, and the
like, God actually and positively wills. And
precisely because these things proceed from
His will, they cannot be bad. God is the
author of all good, and evil He cannot do.
So good, indeed, is He that, if He were not
sufficiently omnipotent to draw good out of
evil, He would never have permitted any
evil to exist. <span class="tei tei-q">“God has judged it better,”</span>
says St. Augustine, <span class="tei tei-q">“to work good out of
evil, than to allow no evil.”</span><a id="noteref_98" name="noteref_98" href="#note_98"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">98</span></span></a> We must not
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page200">[pg 200]</span><a name="Pg200" id="Pg200" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
argue in our foolishness and try to understand
all the doings of God, for His ways
are not our ways, His thoughts not our
thoughts.<a id="noteref_99" name="noteref_99" href="#note_99"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">99</span></span></a> It is often beyond our power
even to understand our fellow-creatures,
and how foolish it is to complain because we
cannot comprehend the great Creator!
Enough for us, if we be sincere and right of
heart, to know, as we do, that God is good,
that He loves us individually, and that His
protecting hand guides and governs all the
events of our lives, even to the smallest detail.
These are truths which we must take
hold of and lay close to our hearts, else we
shall go the way of error and issue in ultimate
disaster.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And from these truths, so certain and unquestionable,
it further follows that everything
existing in the world, so far as it affects
us, everything that falls to our lot, all
that we encounter, all that we suffer, all that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page201">[pg 201]</span><a name="Pg201" id="Pg201" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
we do, aside from sin, has been purposely
arranged by Almighty God for our greater
spiritual good and eternal salvation. This
must be so, since God is the universal cause
of all things, and since He sincerely loves
us and desires above all to save us. If it
were otherwise, either He would not have
omnipotent control of everything, or He
could not be said really to desire our salvation.
How sadly we misunderstand these
great truths in our daily lives, when we
murmur and complain at the evils that afflict
us! How narrowly we conceive the
all-powerful will of God, and the infinite
abyss of His goodness which would lead us
to eternal delights! We would like to escape
all the evils of time, we love our lives,
and we wish to save them from final wreck;
but when failing to trust to the will of God
we forget the words of Christ, that <span class="tei tei-q">“he that
loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth
his life in this world, keepeth it unto
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page202">[pg 202]</span><a name="Pg202" id="Pg202" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

and we are, perhaps, much disturbed about
doing many and great things in the cause of
God and of Heaven, unmindful the while
of the Master's warning that, <span class="tei tei-q">“not every one
that saith to me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into
the kingdom of heaven; but he that doth the
will of my Father who is in heaven, he shall
enter into the kingdom of heaven.”</span><a id="noteref_101" name="noteref_101" href="#note_101"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">101</span></span></a> It is
doubtless our aim to draw ever nearer and
nearer to our Saviour, and to deepen our
relationship with Him; but do we remember
that He said, <span class="tei tei-q">“whosoever shall do the
will of God, he is my brother, and my sister,
and mother?”</span><a id="noteref_102" name="noteref_102" href="#note_102"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">102</span></span></a>

<span class="tei tei-q">“Yes,”</span> you will say, <span class="tei tei-q">“This is all true; I
know it is so; my faith is at fault. If I only

from God that heavenly gift which will

and sees in everything the hand of God?
Surely you can say, with the devout author
of the Imitation of Christ, <span class="tei tei-q">“Behold, Oh

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Perhaps the greatest trial to our faith in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page204">[pg 204]</span><a name="Pg204" id="Pg204" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
divine Providence is in bearing what we call
the wrongs of life. That we should have
any crosses to suffer at all; that there should
be death and sickness and disease; that there
should be poverty and misery, distress and
worry, labor and sorrow; that there should
exist any of these things, is to our infirmity,
if we forget our sins and the sins of our race
that have caused these evils, a trial and a
test of fidelity. But still more is it difficult,
except to minds that are deeply religious, to
meet with the gentleness and serenity of
faith the positive injuries—the injustice,
the scorn, the ridicule, the pain and persecution
which others, needy creatures like
ourselves, actually inflict upon us. It is
easier, we say, to bear poverty than insult;
it is easier to suffer the inclemency of the
elements than to endure the unkindness of
our brethren; it is easier to put up with the
pain and weariness of bodily sickness than to
come under the lash of the tongues of men.
There is here, however, no room for hesitation
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page205">[pg 205]</span><a name="Pg205" id="Pg205" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and question; the rule is the same for
all the crosses that come to us. God often
permits us to be afflicted by the sins of others
for our greater spiritual profit. Since,
therefore, all alike proceed from God,
either by positive act or divine permission,
and since we know that He is supremely
good and loves us, having given every proof
of His desire to save us, even to the delivering
up of His only Son,<a id="noteref_106" name="noteref_106" href="#note_106"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">106</span></span></a> we can never reasonably
or sincerely doubt that every evil
and cross of life, with the sole exception of
our personal sins, has been arranged for our
good. My God, do Thou teach us the wisdom
of the cross! <span class="tei tei-q">“For this is a favor to
Thy friend, that for love of Thee he may
suffer and be afflicted in the world, how
often soever and by whom soever Thou permittest
such trials to befall him.”</span><a id="noteref_107" name="noteref_107" href="#note_107"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">107</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is helpful that here also, in learning to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page206">[pg 206]</span><a name="Pg206" id="Pg206" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
discern the source and meaning of our afflictions,
we have ever before us the examples
of the holiest souls. We know that
in all trials they steadfastly look beyond the
cross that presses them to the hand of Him
who has placed it there. Like the shepherd's
sheep, they are convinced of the
power and goodness of their Master, and
nothing can shake their trust in Him.
Without distinction or question they accept
all as coming from God by special act or
sovereign permission, to purify them, to detach
them from the world and creatures, to
increase their nearness and likeness to Himself,
to multiply their merits for Heaven
and bring them to everlasting crowns. They
discover the workings of Providence everywhere,
in things that are painful, as well as
in things that are pleasant to nature. Thus
behind their pangs of body and mind, behind
the whips and scorns of time, behind
the tongue that slanders and calumniates
them, behind the oppressor's wrong, the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page207">[pg 207]</span><a name="Pg207" id="Pg207" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
injustice and tyranny of princes and rulers,
behind all the evils of life they see the hand
of Him who directs and governs all. But
here we must not conclude that the Saints
and holy persons have never resisted evil
and evil-doers, and that consequently we
must not. This would be a serious mistake,
as Church history and hagiography plainly
prove. Who was ever more vigorous and
fearless in opposing wrong and the doers of
wrong than St. Paul, St. Augustine, and St.
Jerome? Who was ever more persistent
in his efforts to prevail against the evils of
sin in others than St. Monica, St. Teresa,
St. Dominic, and St. Catharine of Siena?
After their example, then, we may and we
must struggle against evils of all kinds,
whether physical or spiritual, whether from
ourselves or from others, in so far as it is
not certain that it is the will of God that we
should submit to them. But when we have
exerted ourselves reasonably and lawfully
to rid our lives of that which afflicts us, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page208">[pg 208]</span><a name="Pg208" id="Pg208" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
still it persists, there can be no further doubt
that it is the will of God that we should patiently
and submissively accept our condition
and our cross. Since, however, we do
not know how long it is the wish of Providence
that we should be burdened and afflicted,
we may continue patiently to use
every legitimate means to be delivered, provided
it be done with humble resignation to
the will of our heavenly Father.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The acceptance of injuries, therefore, on
the part of holy souls is not a weak yielding
to inevitable circumstances, nor a willing
consent to the wrongs of others. Like St.
Paul, they know whom they have believed,<a id="noteref_108" name="noteref_108" href="#note_108"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">108</span></span></a>
and they are certain that, in due
time, divine justice will bring all evil-doers
to an evil end and will deliver the just from
their troubles. And further, when the vengeance
of the persecutor is turned upon
them, and they are hunted down without
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page209">[pg 209]</span><a name="Pg209" id="Pg209" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
reason by their kind, even by the members
of their own household, they remember the
words of their Shepherd, <span class="tei tei-q">“The disciple is
not above his master, nor the servant above
his lord. It is enough for the disciple that
he be as his master, and the servant as his
lord. If they have called the good man of
the house Beelzebub, how much more them
of his household!”</span><a id="noteref_109" name="noteref_109" href="#note_109"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">109</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And again, when the servants of God behold
the wicked prospering and the just
oppressed; when they see the ambitious, the
covetous, the unscrupulous preferred and
honored, and they themselves plotted
against and rejected, their heart is not disturbed,
because they know first of all that
<span class="tei tei-q">“to them that love God, all things work together
unto good,”</span><a id="noteref_110" name="noteref_110" href="#note_110"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">110</span></span></a> and secondly, they are
persuaded that the efforts of sinners must
finally fail. <span class="tei tei-q">“For the hope of the wicked is
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page210">[pg 210]</span><a name="Pg210" id="Pg210" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
as dust, which is blown away with the wind,
and as a thin froth which is dispersed by the
storm: and as a smoke that is scattered
abroad by the wind: and as the remembrance
of a guest of one day that passeth
by.”</span><a id="noteref_111" name="noteref_111" href="#note_111"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">111</span></span></a> In a word, then, those who are
really the friends of God have faith and
confidence in their heavenly Master; and all
the perils of earth, and all the powers of
darkness cannot avail to daunt them or turn
them aside from their purpose.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This steadfastness of religious trust we,
in our turn, must strive to acquire. It is
the only way to peace and victory. If we
would ever rise above the evils of our lives
we must learn to look to God for every
thing. And this looking to God must be,
not only as to our bountiful benefactor, but
as to a kind master who knows how best to
discipline his servants and preserve them
from irreparable harm.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page211">[pg 211]</span><a name="Pg211" id="Pg211" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is a substantially correct translation
of the final verse of the Shepherd
Psalm, which may be rendered as follows:
<span class="tei tei-q">“And Thy goodness and kindness pursue
me all the days of my life, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that I may dwell</span></em>
in the house of the Lord forever.”</span> It is the
special wording of the second clause of the
stanza that expresses the real purpose of
divine Providence in regard to the elect.
Everything in life has been ordained and
arranged for their eternal salvation, and for
the increase of their heavenly rewards.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Therefore,”</span> wrote St. Paul to Timothy, <span class="tei tei-q">“I
endure all things for the sake of the elect,
that they also may obtain the salvation,
which is in Christ Jesus, with heavenly
glory.”</span><a id="noteref_112" name="noteref_112" href="#note_112"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">112</span></span></a>
It is this firm conviction that infinite
love is at the bottom of all the workings
of Providence, doing everything for
the sake of the elect, that consoles and
steadies the souls of the just throughout all
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page212">[pg 212]</span><a name="Pg212" id="Pg212" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the trials and crosses of life. In the thick
of the battle they never lose sight of the
faithful Shepherd that leads them, and they
ever behold by faith the unspeakable delights
He has prepared for them that love
Him.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What joys are there in our faith and hope!
If by the mercy and goodness of God we
succeed in saving our souls, how cheap will
seem the price we shall have paid for
Heaven, and how benign and ineffably loving
will appear the Providence of God
which is leading us there! At times now
in our fervor we can faintly and feebly imagine
what it will mean to throw off forever
this veil of faith and see distinctly and continually
the Shepherd of our souls. But
our liveliest conceptions here are infinitely
inferior to the vision to come. <span class="tei tei-q">“To see God
face to face, as He is; to gaze undazzled on
the Three Divine Persons, cognizable and

sight, the endless Generation of the
All-holy Son, and our hearts to hold the joy,
and not die; to watch with spirits all out-stretched
in adoration the ever-radiant and
ineffably beautiful Procession of the Holy
Ghost from the Father and the Son, and to
participate ourselves in that jubilee of jubilees,
and drink in with greedy minds the
wonders of that Procession, and the marvelous
distinctness of its beauty from the Generation
of the Son; to feel ourselves with
ecstatic awe, and yet with seraphic intimacy,
overshadowed by the Person of the Unbegotten
Father, the Father to whom and of
whom we have said so much on earth, the
Fountain of Godhead, who is truly our
Father, while He is also the Father of the
Eternal Son; to explore, with exulting license
and with unutterably glad fear, attribute
after attribute, oceans opening into
oceans of divinest beauty; to lie astonished
in unspeakable contentment before the
vision of God's surpassing Unity, so long
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page214">[pg 214]</span><a name="Pg214" id="Pg214" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the joyous mystery of our predilection, while
the Vision through all eternity seems to
grow more fresh and bright and new: O
my poor soul! what canst thou know of this,
or of these beautiful necessities, of thy exceeding
love, which shall only satisfy itself
in endless alternations, now of silence and
now of song?”</span><a id="noteref_113" name="noteref_113" href="#note_113"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">113</span></span></a>

If regret were possible for the blessed
hereafter, they would never cease to mourn
over the loss of their opportunities on earth
to increase their eternal beatitude. It is
only when the veil shall have been removed
that we shall fully realize how the goodness
and mercy of God have always pursued
us in this life, that we might be saved and
enjoy the rewards of His house forever.
May God give us all that child-like trust in
our heavenly Master which the sheep display

us that vivid constant faith of the Saints
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page215">[pg 215]</span><a name="Pg215" id="Pg215" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
